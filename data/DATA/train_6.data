The	O
most	O
frequent	O
methodological	O
shortcoming	O
in	O

-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-	O
was	O
lack	O
of	O
blinding	O
of	O

to	O
the	O
nature	O

Implications	O
for	O

Well-designed	O

be	O

.	O
And	O
we	O
identified	O
several	O
implications	O
for	O
further	O
research	O
.	O
First,	O
future	O
trials	O
should	O
adequately	O
use	O
random	O
sequence	O

and	O
random	O

and	O
completely	O

Second,	O
future	O
studies	O
should	O
be	O
conducted	O
in	O
populations	O
that	O
best	O
represent	O
patients	O
with	O
chronic	O
LBP;	O
hence,	O
patient	O
selection	O
should	O
be	O
carefully	O
considered	O
.	O
Third,	O
SE	O
should	O
be	O
well	O
designed,	O
and	O
interventions	O
should	O
be	O
thoroughly	O
described	O
.	O
The	O

back	O

between	O

and	O
other	O
forms	O

at	O
a	O
less	O
extent	O
in	O
trials	O
in	O
which	O
SE	O
was	O
performed	O
less	O
frequently	O
-LSB-34-RSB-	O
.	O
Hence,	O
studies	O
should	O
evaluate	O
the	O
frequency	O
at	O
which	O
SE	O
is	O
more	O
effective	O
than	O
others	O
for	O
the	O
treatment	O
of	O
chronic	O
LBP	O
.	O
Fourth,	O
the	O
outcome	O
measures	O
for	O
future	O
studies	O
should	O
include	O
pain	O
intensity,	O
functional	O
status,	O
and	O
general	O
health	O
.	O
This	O
recommendation	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
standard	O
use	O
of	O

measures	O
in	O

health	O
measures	O

.	O
We	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
intermediate	O
or	O
long-term	O
efficacy	O
associated	O
with	O
SE	O
should	O
be	O
accurately	O
assessed,	O

with	O
standardized	O
methods	O
to	O
report	O
outcomes	O
based	O
on	O

Fifth,	O
further	O
studies	O
should	O
also	O
be	O
conducted	O

the	O

of	O

the	O
