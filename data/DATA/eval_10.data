Background
This
study
investigated
the
nature
of
newspaper
reporting
about
online
health
information
in
the
UK
and
US
.
Internet
users
frequently
search
for
health
information
online,
although
the
accuracy
of
the
information
retrieved
varies
greatly
and
can
be
misleading
.
Newspapers
have
the
potential
to
influence
public
health
behaviours,
but
information
has
been
lacking
in
relation
to
how
newspapers
portray
online
health
information
to
their
readers
.
Methods
The
newspaper
database
NexisUK
was
searched
for
articles
published
from
2003
2012
relating
to
online
health
information
.
Systematic
content
analysis
of
articles
published
in
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
was
performed
.
A
second
researcher
coded
a
10%
sample
to
establish
inter-rater
reliability
of
coding
.
Results
In
total,
161
newspaper
articles
were
included
in
the
analysis
.
Publication
was
most
frequent
in
2003,
2008
and
2009,
which
coincided
with
global
threats
to
public
health
.
UK
broadsheet
newspapers
were
significantly
more
likely
to
cover
online
health
information
than
UK
tabloid
newspapers
-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
and
only
one
article
was
identified
in
US
tabloid
newspapers
.
Articles
most
frequently
appeared
in
health
sections
.
Among
the
79
articles
that
linked
online
health
information
to
specific
diseases
or
health
topics,
diabetes
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease,
cancer
the
commonest
group
of
diseases
and
sexual
health
the
most
frequent
health
topic
.
Articles
portrayed
benefits
of
obtaining
online
health
information
more
frequently
than
risks
.
Quotations
from
health
professionals
portrayed
mixed
opinions
regarding
public
access
to
online
health
information
.
108
-LRB-67.1%-RRB-
articles
directed
readers
to
specific
health-related
web
sites
.
135
-LRB-83.9%-RRB-
articles
were
rated
as
having
balanced
judgement
and
76
-LRB-47.2%-RRB-
were
judged
as
having
excellent
quality
reporting
.
No
difference
was
found
in
the
quality
of
reporting
between
UK
and
US
articles
.
Conclusions
Newspaper
coverage
of
online
health
information
was
low
during
the
10-year
period
2003
to
2012
.
Journalists
tended
to
emphasise
the
benefits
and
understate
the
risks
of
online
health
information
and
the
quality
of
reporting
varied
considerably
.
Newspapers
directed
readers
to
sources
of
online
health
information
during
global
epidemics
although,
as
most
articles
appeared
in
the
health
sections
of
broadsheet
newspapers,
coverage
was
limited
to
a
relatively
small
readership
.
Electronic
supplementary
material
The
online
version
of
this
article
-LRB-doi:10.1186/1471-2458-14-1316-RRB-
contains
supplementary
material,
which
is
available
to
authorized
users
.
Background
Approximately
7
in
10
adult
Internet
users
in
the
UK
and
US
search
online
for
health
information
annually
-LSB-1,
2-RSB-
.
Commonly
reported
motivators
for
seeking
online
health
information
include
chronic
illness
-LSB-3,
4-RSB-,
self-diagnosis
-LSB-2-RSB-,
receipt
of
a
new
diagnosis
-LSB-5-RSB-,
dissatisfaction
with
health
care
providers
-LSB-6-RSB-
and
searching
for
lifestyle
advice
-LSB-7-RSB-
.
While
the
Internet
provides
convenient
public
access
to
health
information,
evidence
suggests
that
searching
for
health
information
is
challenging
for
the
average
Internet
user,
not
only
due
to
the
volume
and
variable
quality
of
information
that
may
be
retrieved,
but
also
due
to
differences
in
searching
ability
and
comprehension
among
consumers
-LSB-8,
9-RSB-
.
Furthermore,
many
studies
have
reported
that
the
accuracy
of
health
information
retrieved
in
Internet
searches
varies
greatly
and
can
be
misleading
.
For
example,
Agricola
et
al
reported
recently
that
preconception
advice
retrieved
via
the
Google
search
engine
was
generally
inconsistent
and
frequently
incomplete
-LSB-10-RSB-
and
Singh
et
al
found
that
approximately
one
third
of
YouTube
videos
relating
to
rheumatoid
arthritis
contained
misleading
information
and
over
90%
promoted
unscientific
therapies
-LSB-11-RSB-
.
Using
inaccurate
or
misleading
health
information
for
decision
making
purposes,
without
expert
advice,
could
potentially
have
a
serious
negative
impact
on
the
individual
user
and
on
public
health
in
general
-LSB-12-RSB-
.
Thus,
it
is
paramount
that
consumers
are
informed
of
the
risks
associated
with
searching
for
health
information
online
and
information
seekers
should
be
directed
to
accurate
and
credible
web
sites
.
Who
should
perform
these
roles?
.
Media
coverage
is
an
important
source
of
public
knowledge
on
health-related
issues
and
evidence
suggests
that
the
mass
media
has
the
potential
to
influence
health
behaviours
-LSB-13-RSB-
.
Newspapers
are
an
important
element
of
the
mass
media
and
approximately
one
third
of
adults
in
Great
Britain
read
at
least
one
national
daily
newspaper
each
day
-LSB-14-RSB-
.
However,
evidence
suggests
that
the
quality
of
health
reporting
in
newspapers
tends
to
be
poor
.
An
evaluation
of
500
health
news
stories
published
in
US
newspapers
between
2006
and
2008
reported
that
between
62%
and
77%
of
articles
failed
to
adequately
address
costs,
harms,
benefits,
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
the
existence
of
other
options
when
covering
health
care
products
and
procedures
-LSB-15-RSB-
.
Furthermore,
newspapers
tend
to
overemphasise
benefits
and
under-represent
risks
when
reporting
on
health
interventions
-LSB-16,
17-RSB-
.
Nothing
is
known
about
how
the
newspaper
media
portray
the
Internet
as
a
source
of
health
information
.
Journalists
often
use
health
web
sites
as
information
sources
for
their
articles
but
rarely
comment
on
their
quality
or
credibility
-LSB-18-RSB-
.
Ideally,
newspaper
articles
should
be
accurate
and
balanced
so
that
readers
can
make
informed
decisions
regarding
the
Internet
as
a
source
of
health
information
.
If
newspaper
reporting
is
inaccurate,
imbalanced,
or
incomplete,
readers
may
develop
unrealistic
perceptions
of
the
value
of
online
health
information,
therefore,
the
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
how
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portray
health
information
on
the
Internet,
including
social
media,
websites
and
blogs,
to
the
public
in
terms
of
the
frequency,
nature
and
quality
of
reporting
.
Methods
Study
design
We
employed
systematic
content
analysis
to
examine
how
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portrayed
online
health
information
in
the
10-year
period
between
1st
January
2003
and
the
31st
December
2012
.
Selection
of
newspaper
articles
The
NexisUK
database
is
a
full
text
archive
of
newspapers
published
globally
and
has
been
used
widely
in
previous
studies
of
media
coverage
of
health-related
issues
-LSB-1921-RSB-
.
We
searched
a
purposive
sample
of
UK

and
ten
daily

together
with
their
Sunday

at
the
time
of
commencement
of

-LSB-23-RSB-,
which
comprised
USA
Today,
Wall

Search
strategy
Following
empiric
testing
of
several
search
terms,
we
used
the
search
term
Internet
AND
health
information
to
search
the
NexisUK
database
for
all
articles
-LRB-including
news
articles,
editorials,
magazine
supplements,
letters,
etc.-RRB-
that
contained
any
reference
to
the
search
term
in
either
the
headline
or
text
during
the
period
from
1st
January
2003
to
31st
December
2012
.
The
primary
researcher
-LRB-BMcC-RRB-
retrieved
and
read
all
of
the
archived
newspaper
articles
.
Items
were
excluded
if
online
health
information
was
mentioned
only
briefly
-LRB-i.e
<10%
of
the
article
by
word
count-RRB-,
if
they
focussed
on
business
issues
-LRB-e.g
technology
company
share
prices-RRB-
or
if
online
health
information
was
mentioned
only
as
part
of
an
announcement,
e.g
announcement
of
an
adult
learning
class
.
We
included
only
the
article
with
the
highest
word
count
when
an
article
was
duplicated
in
both
a
daily
newspaper
and
its
Sunday
equivalent
.
We
searched
the
PubMed
database
using
the
same
search
terms
and
dates
to
compare
the
frequency
of
publication
of
newspaper
articles
with
publication
of
scientific
articles
related
to
this
topic
.
Article
coding
We
established
an
a
priori
coding
system
based
on
systems
used
in
previously
published
systematic
media
content
analyses
-LSB-1619-RSB-
.
This
consisted
of
a
codebook
containing
the
list
of
variables
to
be
researched,
along
with
standardised
responses
and
coding
instructions,
and
a
coding
form
-LRB-see
Additional
file
1-RRB-
.
This
approach
provided
a
consistent
coding
framework
and
limited
the
potential
for
subjective
judgement
by
coders
.
Two
coders
piloted
the
coding
framework
by
coding
a
random
sample
of
ten
articles
independently
.
Following
the
pilot,
minor
adjustments
were
made
to
the
coding
system
to
increase
its
specificity
.
The
final
coding
frame
comprised
four
main
sections:
firstly;
the
name
of
the
newspaper,
the
title
of
the
article,
its
year
of
publication
and
the
newspaper
section
in
which
the
article
of
interest
appeared
were
recorded
.
Secondly;
the
themes
covered,
the
perspective
from
which
the
article
was
written,
whether
the
focus
was
on
a
particular
health
sector
or
illness,
benefits/risks
or
barriers/facilitators
relating
to
the
use
of
online
health
information
in
routine
clinical
practice,
and
the
source
of
the
information
contained
in
the
article
were
noted
.
In
the
third
section,
coders
were
required
to
make
subjective
judgements
on
the
main
emphasis
of
the
article,
claim
and
quality
of
information
.
Finally,
if
a
scientific
journal
article
was
identified
as
the
source
of
information
for
the
newspaper
article,
all
reasonable
steps
were
taken
to
obtain
the
scientific
paper
and
its
title,
authors,
publication
date
and
disclosure
of
conflict
of
interest
were
recorded
.
The
primary
researcher
-LRB-BMcC-RRB-
used
the
final
coding
form
to
manually
code
the
selected
articles
.
A
second
coder
coded
a
10%
random
sub-sample
blindly
and
Cohens
kappa
-LRB--RRB-
scores
were
calculated
to
assess
inter-rater
agreement
for
questions
with
mutually
exclusive
answers
.
Questions
with
more
than
two
answers
were
dichotomised,
for
example,
Type
of
benefits
of
health-related
use
of
the
Internet
-LRB-nine
options
provided-RRB-,
was
collapsed
to
Was
a
benefit
stated?
.
-LRB-yes/no-RRB-
.
Where
diseases
were
specifically
mentioned,
they
were
classified
according
to
the
relevant
chapter
in
the
British
National
Formulary
-LRB-BNF-RRB-,
63rd
edition
-LRB-British
Medical
Association
and
the
Royal
Pharmaceutical
Society,
2012-RRB-
.
Statistical
analysis
Following
data
extraction,
codes
were
entered
into
SPSS
-LRB-version
19,
SPSS
Inc,
USA-RRB-
for
analysis
of
trends
and
comparison
of
variables
between
countries
.
Descriptive
statistics
were
used
to
summarise
the
data
.
The
Mann-Whitney
U
test
was
used
to
test
for
differences
between
means
of
continuous
variables
.
Differences
in
the
reporting
of
categorical
variables
in
UK
and
US
articles
were
assessed
using
the
Chi
square
test
-LRB-2-RRB-
or
the
Fishers
Exact
test,
as
appropriate
.
Statistical
significance
was
set
at
0.05
.
Results
Initially,
749
newspaper
articles
were
retrieved,
of
which
161
articles,
74
from
UK
papers
and
87
from
US
newspapers
remained
following
removal
of
duplicates
and
excluded
articles
-LRB-Figure1-RRB-
.
Inter-rater
kappa
values
ranged
from
0.5
to
1.0,
indicating
moderate
to
perfect
agreement
between
coders
-LSB-24-RSB-
.
The
mean
inter-rater
kappa
value
across
all
of
the
coded
variables
was
0.65;
this
is
similar
to
the
level
of
inter-rater
agreement
reported
in
previous
quantitative
content
analyses
involving
the
newspaper
media
-LSB-19,

Frequency
of
newspaper
reporting
The
number
of
articles
retrieved
from
UK
and
US
newspapers
ranged
from
7
in
2012
to
24
in
2009,
indicating
a
low
publication
frequency
relating
to
this
topic
.
The
highest
numbers
of
articles
were
published
in
2003
-LRB-21

2008
-LRB-21

and
2009
-LRB-24
articles-RRB-,
with
a
marked
decline
in
reporting
on
online
health
information
after
2009
-LRB-Figure2-RRB-
.
In
the
UK,
the
overall
trend
in
reporting
remained
relatively
constant
throughout
the
10-year
period,
while
an
overall
downward
trend
was
observed
in
the
US
.
During
the
same
period
there
was
an
increase
in
scientific
articles
on
this
topic
archived
in
PubMed
-LRB-Figure3-RRB-,
indicating
that,
during
this
time,
online
health
information
is
a
topic
that
has
been
researched
actively.Figure

Newspaper
type
and
positioning
of
articles
Strictly
speaking,
the
terms
broadsheet
and
tabloid
refer
to
newspaper
dimensions,
however,
broadsheet
newspapers
are
perceived
to
be
more
intellectual
in
content
in
comparison
to
tabloids,
which
tend
to
report
more
sensationalist
and
celebrity
material
.
Articles
relating
to
online
health
information
were
published
more
frequently
in
broadsheet
newspapers
than
in
tabloid
newspapers
.
Indeed,
only
one
relevant
article
was
found
in
the
US
tabloid
press
over
the
entire
10-year
period
of
interest
.
In
the
UK,
on
average,
4.9
articles
-LRB-SD
2.8-RRB-
were
published
in
broadsheet
newspapers
per
year,
which
was
significantly
higher
than
the
average
of
2.5
-LRB-SD
2.0-RRB-
articles
published
in
tabloid
newspapers
annually
-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
.
In
approximately
two
thirds
-LRB-68.3%-RRB-
of
articles,
it
was
obvious
from
the
headline
that
the
article
related
to
health
information
on
the
Internet
.
Approximately
a
quarter
of
the
selected
articles
-LRB-24.8%-RRB-
were
published
in
health
sections
and
approximately
one
fifth
appeared
in
feature
-LRB-18.6%-RRB-
and
business
-LRB-18.0%-RRB-
sections
.
Interestingly,
on
only
one
occasion
did
the
topic
feature
in
the
editorial/leader
section,
indicating
the
low
priority
given
to
the
topic
by
newspaper
editors
.
Authorship
and
information
sources
Journalists
wrote
a
substantial
proportion
of
the
articles
-LRB-83.2%-RRB-
and
health
professionals
wrote
relatively
few
-LRB-9.9%-RRB-,
although,
in
approximately
a
quarter
-LRB-22.4%-RRB-
of
the
articles
authored
by
journalists,
a
health
professional
was
cited
as
the
main
source
of
the
information
.
Other
sources
included
published
reports
or
articles,
or
their
authors
-LRB-18.6%-RRB-,
spokespersons
from
the
IT
industry
-LRB-12.4%-RRB-
or
from
a
Government/National
Health
Service
-LRB-NHS-RRB-
department
-LRB-9.3%-RRB-
.
Thirty
articles
were
informed
by
a
scientific
report
or
journal
article
.
The
most
frequently
cited
reports
were
those
published
by
the
Pew
Internet
and
American
Life
Project
.
Almost
two
thirds
of
the
articles
-LRB-62.7%-RRB-
included
quotations
from
patients,
medical
or
industry
experts
.
Content
of
newspaper
articles
Online
health
information
was
the
main
theme
in
the
majority
-LRB-65.2%-RRB-
of
articles
.
Other
themes
included
the
Internet
as
a
medium
for
health-related
communication
between
the
public
and/or
health
professionals
-LRB-11.8%-RRB-,
access
to
online
personal

Balance
and
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
The
majority
of
articles
-LRB-83.9%-RRB-
were
rated
as
having
balanced
judgement,
i.e
the
authors
neither
made
exaggerated
nor
understated
claims
in
comparison
with
the
generally
accepted
status
of
online
health
information
.
The
quality
of
information
presented
in
each
article
was
rated
with
the
aid
of
descriptors
on
a
scale
of
1-10
.
Higher
scores
indicated
higher
quality
reporting
.
A
typical
high
quality
article
had
balanced
judgement,
was
based
on
evidence,
and
included
quotations
from
subject
experts,
whereas,
an
article
was
rated
as
poor
if
it
was
anecdotal,
lacked
balanced
judgement
and
did
not
include
any
evidence
in
support
of
its
claims
.
Overall,
47.2%
of
the
articles
were
rated
as
having
excellent

Discussion
We
found
a
low
frequency
of
reporting
on
online
health
information
in
the
highest
circulation
UK
and
US
newspapers
during
the
period
1st
January
2003
to
31st
December
2012
.
During
the
same
period,
the
number
of
relevant
research
studies
archived
in
PubMed
more
than
doubled
from
130
papers
in
2003
to
279
papers
in
2012
.
Newspapers
are
more
likely
to
report
on
studies
that
have
been
press-released
-LSB-26-RSB-,
therefore,
the
low
level
of
reporting
may
be
attributed
to
lack
of
promotion
of
research
to
newspaper
editors
by
scientists
or
journals
that
publish
in
this
area
.
Alternatively,
newspaper
editors
may
perceive
that
the
use
of
the
Internet
as
a
health
information
source
is
not
newsworthy
or
that
the
potential
for
harm
associated
with
reliance
on
online
health
information
is
not
an
important
public
health
issue
.
Although
overall
UK
and
US
newspaper
reporting
on
online
health
information
was
low,
peaks
were
evident
in
2003
and
in
2009
-LRB-Figure2-RRB-
.
During
the
analysis,
we
noted
that
the
majority
of
articles
published
in
these
years
reported
the
advice
and
information
available
online
during
the
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
-LRB-SARS-RRB-
outbreak
in
2003
and
the
H1N1
influenza
pandemic
in
2009
.
This
suggests
that
both
UK
and
US
newspaper
editors
saw
a
need
to
inform
the
public
where
to
look
for
health
information
at
times
when
public
health
was
threatened
.
Indeed,
UK
newspaper
reporting
on
the
H1N1
virus
in
general
peaked
during
the
summer
of
2009,
mirroring
the
peak
in
UK
cases
of
swine
flu
-LSB-25-RSB-
.
This
finding
supports
Gupta
and
Sinhas
assertion
that
coverage
of
health
concerns
in
the
news
media
tends
to
be
higher
when
the
issue
affects
the
greatest
number
of
people
in
their
audience
-LSB-27-RSB-
.
Broadsheet
versus
tabloid
reporting
on
online
health
information
A
broad
range
of
newspapers
across
the
readership
spectrum
was
included
in
the
study
.
Articles
in
the
US
newspaper
media
were
almost
exclusively
published
in
broadsheet
newspapers
.
Similarly,
significantly
more
UK
articles
were
published
in
broadsheets
even
though
tabloid
papers
made
up
a
greater
proportion
of
the
UK
sample
.
The
National
Readership
Survey
indicates
that
the
three
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
-LRB-The
Sun,
Daily
Mail,
Daily
Mirror-RRB-
are
all
tabloids
and
are
predominantly
read
by
lower
-LRB-C2DE-RRB-
social
classes
-LSB-14-RSB-
.
Thus,
readers
of
the
tabloid
press
are
unlikely
to
receive
guidance
on
searching
for
or
using
online
health
information,
or
web
site
recommendations,
from
their
newspapers
.
Also,
within
broadsheet
newspapers,
the
majority
of
articles
appeared
in
their
health
sections,
which
suggests
that
these
important
messages
may
be
reaching
a
very
limited
range
of
readers
.
Content
of
newspaper
articles
Our
results
support
Adelman
and
Verbrugges
suggestion
that
diseases
associated
with
high
mortality
rates
receive
the
highest
volume
of
newspaper
coverage
-LSB-28-RSB-
.
In
articles
that
linked
online
health
information
to
specific
diseases,
diabetes
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
illness,
while
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease
categories
were
the
central
nervous
system
-LRB-CNS-RRB-,
malignant
disease
and
cardiovascular
disease
.
Articles
that
discussed
online
health
information
in
relation
to
CNS
disease
encompassed
a
wide
range
of
both
neurological
and
mental
illnesses,
although
depression
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease
in
this
category
.
The
relatively
high
level
of
newspaper
reporting
on
this
illness
correlates
with
suicide
being
the
leading
cause
of
death
in
adults
under
the
age
of
35
years
in
the
UK
-LSB-29-RSB-
.
Our
results
reinforce
the
suggestion
of
previous
researchers
that
newspapers
overemphasise
benefits
and
under-represent
risks
when
reporting
on
health
interventions
-LSB-16,
17-RSB-
.
It
was
interesting
to
observe
that
this
disparity
was
greater
among
US
newspapers,
although
the
differences
between
UK
and
US
newspapers
were
not
statistically
significant
.
Overstating
the
benefits
of
online
health
information
may
raise
public
expectations
unrealistically,
potentially
leading
to
harm
if
an
individual
acts
on
misleading
information
without
discussing
their
intentions
with
a
health
professional
.
The
acceptability
of
the
Internet
as
a
credible
source
of
health
information
in
clinical
practice
largely
depends
on
how
it
is
perceived
by
health
care
professionals
.
Opinions
expressed
in
articles
were
mixed
although
more
professionals
-LRB-55%-RRB-
expressed
positive
views
.
Quality
of
press
reporting
Our
findings
add
to
the
body
of
evidence
that
the
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
on
health
issues
is
variable
.
Less
than
half
of
articles
were
classified
as
having
excellent
information
and
the
remainder
were
deemed
to
be
of
average/good
or
poor
quality
.
Wilson
et
al
reported
poor
but
improving
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
on
a
variety
of
health
interventions
between
2004
and
2008
-LSB-30-RSB-
whereas
Hilton
and
Hunt
found
that
newspaper
reporting
during
the
2009
H1N1
influenza
epidemic
was
largely
measured
-LSB-25-RSB-
.
Strengths
and
limitations
of
study
This
is
the
first
comprehensive
investigation
of
how
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portray
online
health
information
to
their
readers
.
Although
the
mass
media
encompasses
the
Internet,
television,
radio,
newspapers
and
magazines,
we
limited
the
scope
of
our
study
to
the
newspaper
media
for
several
reasons
.
Firstly,
newspapers
have
a
wide
readership
in
both
the
UK
and
US
.
Secondly,
the
existence
of
an
online
database
of
full
text
newspaper
articles
provided
an
efficient
mechanism
to
search
for
and
obtain
articles
published
within
the
period
of
interest
.
Thirdly,
there
is
evidence
of
a
strong
correlation
between
newspaper
reporting
and
other
mass
media
coverage
of
similar
issues
-LSB-31-RSB-
.
Our
analysis
was
limited
to
higher
circulation
newspapers,
although,
circulation
figures
are
estimated
based
on
the
number
of
newspapers
sold
and
not
on
the
actual
readership
.
Finally,
there
was
limited
availability
of
some
US
newspaper
articles
within
the
NexisUK
database
.
Only
the
previous
six
months
of
Los
Angeles
Times
articles
and
only
abstracts
of
Wall
Street
Journal
articles
were
available
.
Further
limitations
are
the
retrospective
nature
of
the
data
collection,
although
a
prospective
study
over
10
years
would
be
impractical,
and
the
use
of
a
single
coder
for
the
majority
of
the
data
collection,
although
a
calibration
exercise
with
a
second
coder
was
undertaken
.
Conclusions
The
extent
of
newspaper
coverage
of
health
information
on
the
Internet
was
found
to
be
low
in
comparison
to
the
level
of
research
published
on
this
topic
.
In
common
with
the
findings
of
previous
research
on
newspaper
coverage
of
health
issues,
journalists
tended
to
emphasise
the
benefits
and
understate
the
risks
of
online
health
information,
and
the
quality
of
reporting
varied
considerably
.
Articles
that
reported
on
online
health
information
focussed
on
common
illnesses
that
are
associated
with
high
mortality
rates
.
Nevertheless,
newspaper
editors
perceived
a
need
to
report
on
online
information
when
public
health
was
threatened
by
global
epidemics
.
Dissemination
was
generally
via
the
health
sections
of
broadsheet
newspapers,
limiting
coverage
to
a
relatively
small
and
potentially
already
well-informed
readership
.

Prolonged
hyperglycemia
is
an
important

factor

-LRB-DR-RRB-
.
Extracellular
matrix
molecules,
such
as
fibronectin,

laminin,
are
associated
with
fibrotic

.
In
this
study,
we
investigated
the
expression
of
fibronectin,
collagen

and
laminin
in
RPE
cells
under
high
glucose
conditions
.
Furthermore,
we
also
detected
the
phosphorylation
of
protein
kinase
B
-LRB-Akt-RRB-
under
high
glucose
conditions
in
RPE
cells
.
Our
results
showed
that
high
glucose
upregulated
fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin
expression,
and
activated
Akt
in
RPE
cells
.
We
also
found
that
pretreatment
with
LY294002
-LRB-an
inhibitor
of
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-RRB-
abolished
high
glucose-induced
expression
of
fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin
in
RPE
cells
.
Thus,
high
glucose
induced
the
expression
of
fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin
through
PI3K/Akt
signaling
pathway
in
RPE
cells,
and
the
PI3K/Akt
signaling
pathway
may
contribute
to
the
formation
of
fibrotic
membrane
during
the
development
of
DR

Introduction
Diabetic
retinopathy
-LRB-DR-RRB-
is
a
major
cause
of
adult
blindness
globally
-LSB-1-RSB-
.
Prolonged
hyperglycemia
plays
a
vital
role
in
the
development
of
DR
Increased
synthesis
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
contributes
to
the
thickening
of
the
basement
membrane,
which
is
common
in
DR
-LSB-2-RSB-
.
Proliferative
DR,
an
advanced
stage
of
DR,
is
characterized
by
epiretinal
outgrowth
of
fibrotic
membranes
at
the
vitreoretinal
interface
.
Retinal
pigment
epithelial
-LRB-RPE-RRB-
cells,
which
are
located
between
the
neurosensory
retina
and
the
vascular
choroids,
form
the
outer
blood-retinal
barrier
and
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathological
processes
that
lead
to
the
loss
of
vision
.
The
breakdown
of
the
outer
blood-retinal
barrier
can
activate
RPE
cells,
which
then
initiate
proliferation
and
migration
and
secrete
extracellular
matrix
molecules
to
combat
certain
diseases,
such
as
proliferative
vitreoretinopathy
-LRB-PVR-RRB-
-LSB-3-RSB-,
proliferative
DR
-LSB-4-RSB-,
and
age-related
macular
degeneration
-LRB-AMD-RRB-
-LSB-5-RSB-
.
The
main
components
of
the
fibrotic
membranes
are
extracellular
matrix
molecules,
which
are
combined
with
some
cell
types
.
It
has
been
confirmed
that
RPE
and
other
cell
types
contribute
to
the
formation
of
fibrotic
membranes
-LSB-6,
7-RSB-
.
The
PI3K/AKT
pathway
is
important
not
only
in
the
development
of
many
diseases
but
also
for
signaling
in
normal
cells
.
This
pathway
plays
a
key
role
in
numerous
cellular
functions,
including
adhesion,
proliferation,
migration,
invasion,
metabolism,

Discussion
Hyperglycemia
is
one
of
the
most
important
risk
factors
for
the
development
of
DR
Sustained
hyperglycemia
can
activate
many
factors,
cytokines,
and
other
molecules
.
The
expression
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
was
detected
in
many
organs
of
diabetes
patients
and
cell
types
under
high
glucose
conditions
-LSB-2225-RSB-
.
It
has
also
been
proven
that
extracellular
matrix
molecules
are
involved
in
the
formation
of
fibrotic
membranes
and
the
thickening
of
basement
membrane
during
the
development
of
DR
-LSB-26-RSB-
.
In
the
present
study,
we
demonstrated
that,
compared
with
the
control
group,
high
glucose
significantly
increased
the
induction
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
-LRB-fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin-RRB-
in
RPE
cells
when
exposed
to
25mM
glucose
for
24h
.
However,
information
about
the
link
between
high
glucose
and
extracellular
matrix
molecules
remains
unclear
.
To
gain
further
insight
into
the
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
high
glucose
induces
the
expression
of
fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin
in
RPE
cells,
we
examined
intracellular
signaling
pathways
.
Our
results
showed
that
the
phosphorylation
of
Akt
was
activated
when
exposed
to
high
glucose
at
5min,
10min,
and
30min
in
RPE
cells
.
It
has
been
reported
that
sustained
endothelial
activation
of
Akt
induces
the
formation
of
structurally
and
functionally
abnormal
blood
vessels
that
recapitulate
the
aberrations
of
tumor
vessels
-LSB-27-RSB-
.
Studies
have
also
demonstrated
that
the
inhibition
of
Akt
signaling
could
inhibit
pathological
vascularization
-LSB-28-RSB-
.
Inhibition
of
PI3K/Akt
signaling
should
be
considered
especially
in
cancer
therapy
because
the
inappropriate
activation
of
this
pathway
is
frequently
observed
in
many
tumor
types
-LSB-29-RSB-
.
This
study
showed
that
the
expression
of
fibronectin,
collagen
IV,
and
laminin
was
significantly
decreased
when
pretreated
with
LY294002
for
12h
and
then
exposed
to
high
glucose
conditions
for
an
additional
24h
in
RPE
cells
.
Fibrosis
is
defined
as
the
excessive
deposition
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
into
organs
and
tissues
.
Extracellular
matrix
molecules
and
RPE
cells
contribute
to
the
formation
of
fibrotic
membranes
in
proliferative
DR
-LSB-6,
7,
26-RSB-
.
The
present
study
demonstrated
that
high
glucose
significantly
promoted
the
induction
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
and
the
phosphorylation
of
Akt
under
high
glucose
conditions
in
RPE
cells
.
In
addition,
inhibition
of
the
PI3K/Akt
signaling
pathway
significantly
decreased
the
expression
of
extracellular
matrix
molecules
under
high
glucose
conditions
in
these
cells
.
Thus,
the
PI3K/Akt
signaling
pathway
may
contribute
to
the
formation
of
fibrotic
membranes
during
the
development
of
DR
.
A
34-year-old
woman
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
of
recently
aggravated
right
heart
failure
without
angina
for
5
months
.
When
she
was
25
years
old,
patch
repair
with
Polytetrafluoroethylene
-LRB-PTFE-RRB-
was
performed
for
the
secondum
type
of
atrial
septal
defect
-LRB-ASD-RRB-
with
moderate
pulmonary
hypertension
.
The
chest
PA,
echocardiography
and
cardiac
catheterization
at
current
admission
revealed
Eisenmenger
syndrome
without
intracardiac
shunt
.
Chest
CT
scan
with
contrast
revealed
markedly
dilated
pulmonary
trunk,
both
pulmonary
arteries
and
concave
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
of
the
ascending
aorta
suggesting
extrinsic
compression,
as
well
as
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
that
was
retrogradly
filled
with
collateral
circulation
from
the
right
coronary
artery
.
The
coronary
angiography
showed
normal
right
coronary
artery
and
the
collaterals
that
come
out
from
the
conus
branch
to
the
mid-left
anterior
descending
artery
-LRB-LAD-RRB-
and
that
from
distal
right
coronary
artery
to
the
left
circumflex
artery
-LRB-LCX-RRB-
and
to
the
distal
LAD,
respectively
.
On
aortography,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
not
visualized
with
no
stump,
suggestive
of
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
.
From
our
experience,
it
is
possible
to
say
that
the
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
can
be
induced
by
the
dilated
pulmonary
artery
trunk
due
to
ASD
with
pulmonary
hypertension
and
that,
if
the
ASD
closure
was
too
late,
the
narrowing
or
obstruction
of
the
left
coronary
artery
could
not
be
resolved
even
after
operation
owing
to
irreversible
pulmonary
hypertension
.
INTRODUCTION
Atrial
septal
defect
in
the
middle-aged
and
elderly,
which
is
associated
with
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery,
usually
induces
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
in
cases
of
un-correction
or
delayed
corrective
surgery13-RRB-
.
Furthermore,
the
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
is
associated
with
hemodynamic
compromise
of
the
left
ventricle
and
sudden
cardiac
death
due
to
the
collapse
of
systemic
circulation
.
However,
the
causes
of
sudden
death
in
the
patient
with
severe
pulmonary
hypertension
have
remained
uncertain
.
Among
the
causes
of
death,
the
failure
of
coronary
circulation
might
be
one
of
the
causes
.
In
this
case,
we
reviewed
total
occlusion
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
caused
by
extrinsic
compression
of
the
markedly
dilated
main
pulmonary
trunk47-RRB-
that
was
induced
by
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
due
to
delayed
closure
of
the
atrial
septal
defect
.

A
34-year-old
woman
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
of
recently

In
her

arterial
systolic
pressure
-LRB-PASP-RRB-
of
51
mmHg
and
the
diameter
of
main
pulmonary
artery
of
40
mm,
which
were
suggestive
of
significant
left
to
right
shunt
with
moderate
pulmonary
hypertension,
and
normal
coronary
artery
.
As
the
PASP
during
the
postoperative
care
was
not
decreased
to
the
normal
range,
the
doctor
who
operated
on
the
patient
cautioned
and
wrote
on
her
record
of
the
possibility
of
progressing
pulmonary
hypertension
.
On
admission,
blood
pressure
and
pulse
rate
were
110/70
mmHg
and
85
beats
per
minute,
respectively
.
On
physical
examination,
there
were
engorged
neck
vein,
soft
abdominal
distension,
palpable
liver,
and
pretibial
pitting
edema
.
Systolic
murmur
of
grade
III/VI
was
auscultated
from
her
lower
sternal
border
.
The
arterial
blood
gas
analysis
showed
pO2
of
77.4
mmHg,
pCo2
of
31.2
mmHg
under
the
room
air
.
The
rheumatoid
factor
-LRB-RF-RRB-
and
VDRL
for
syphilis
were
both
negative
.
The
electrocardiogram
revealed
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
incomplete
right
bundle
branch
block
and
biventricular
hypertrophy
.
The
chest
PA
showed
markedly
enlarged
cardiac
size
with
prominently
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery
and
centralization
of
pulmonary
hilum,
suggesting
pulmonary
arterial
hypertension
-LRB-Figure
1-RRB-
.
Echocardiogram
with
Doppler
study
demonstrated
right
ventricular
hypertrophy,
D-shape
left
ventricle,
as
well
as
severe
pulmonary
and
tricuspid
regurgitation,
which
corresponded
to
right
ventricular
systolic
pressure
of
117
mmHg
.
However,
there
was
no
intracardiac
shunt
remained
on
color
interrogation
.
Moreover,
serial
echocardiographic
evaluation
had
revealed
the
progression
of
pulmonary
hypertension
after
delivery
of
her
baby
.
A
diagnosis
of
Eisenmenger
syndrome
was
made
.
The
base-line
study
for
heart-lung
transplantation,
including
chest
computed
tomography
-LRB-CT-RRB-,
cardiac
catheterization
and
coronary
angiography
were
undertaken
.
Chest
CT
scan
with
contrast
revealed
markedly
dilated
pulmonary
trunk
and
both
pulmonary
arteries
-LRB-Figure
2A-RRB-,
a
concave
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
of
the
ascending
aorta
and
nearly
total
occlusion
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
that
was
retrogradly
filled
with
collateral
circulation
from
the
right
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
That
was
suggestive
of
compression
of
the
left
side
of
the
aorta
and
the
left
main
coronary
artery
together
by
the
pulmonary
trunk
passing
by
the
ascending
aortas
left
side
.
Cardiac
catheterization
revealed
PASP
of
105
mmHg,
Qp/Qs
of
1
and
Rp/Rs
of
1.4
-LRB-Figure
3-RRB-,
which
mean
no
remaining
shunt
but
much
aggravated
pulmonary
hypertension
compatible
with
Eisenmenger
syndrome
compared
with
preoperative
data
.
The
coronary
angiography
showed
normal
right
coronary
artery
and
the
collaterals
that
came
out
from
the
conus
branch
to
mid-left
anterior
descending
artery
-LRB-LAD-RRB-
and
that
from
the
distal
right
coronary
artery
to
the
left
circumflex
artery
-LRB-LCX-RRB-
and
to
the
distal
LAD,
respectively
-LRB-Figure
4,
5-RRB-
.
Engagement
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
with
the
diagnostic
coronary
catheter
was
not
available
.
On
aortography,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
not
visualized
with
no
stump,
suggesting
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
6-RRB-
.
There
was
no
other
luminal
lesion
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
coronary
artery
system
and
the
thoracic
as
well
as
the
abdominal
aorta
.
DISCUSSION
Some
adults
with
congenital
heart
disease
have
associated
ischemic
heart
disease3,
8-RRB-
.
On
the
other
hand,
atherosclerosis9-RRB-,
syphilis10-RRB-,
aortitis11,
12-RRB-
and
congenital
anomalies
of
the
coronary
artery1314-RRB-
are
widely-known
causes
of
stenosis
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
.
Compression
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
has
not
been
widely
known
.
However,
in
1957,
Corday,
et
al.4-RRB-
first
pointed
out
that
the
distended
main
pulmonary
artery
easily
compressed
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
because
of
the
spatial
position
of
the
proximal
part
of
the
left
coronary
artery
closed
to
the
main
pulmonary
artery
.
Schaffer,
et
al.5-RRB-
tried
to
prove
the
correlation
between
pulmonary
pressure
and
coronary
flow
at
autopsy
which,
however,
was
unsuccessful
because
the
main
pulmonary
artery
of
the
autopsied
heart
was
not
sufficiently
dilated
.
Mitsudo
et
al.6-RRB-
first
reported
the
case
of
a
female
patient
with
ASD
that
was
combined
with
severe
narrowing
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
on
angiography
.
After
the
patient
died
suddenly,
the
postmortem
examination
confirmed
no
anatomic
or
pathological
abnormality
of
the
coronary
arteries
.
Also,
they
reported
that,
in
adults
with
ASD
and
pulmonary
hypertension,
the
coronary
angiography
revealed
localized
concave
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
orifice
in
7
-LRB-44%-RRB-
of
16
patients
.
In
patients
without
pulmonary
hypertension,
however,
these
findings
were
not
observed
.
Fijiwara
et
al.7-RRB-
reported
3
cases
of
adult
ASD
with
compression
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
by
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery
.
In
one
patient
of
the
three,
magnetic
resonance
imaging
study
demonstrated
that
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
ran
close
to
the
left
main
pulmonary
artery
so
that
the
markedly
distended
pulmonary
artery
easily
compressed
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
.
In
two
of
the
three
cases,
one
case
died
because
of
septicemia
after
closure
of
ASD,
the
narrowed
left
main
coronary
artery
was
no
longer
narrowed
or
improved
the
severity
of
narrowing
after
closure
of
ASD
.
In
our
case,
pulmonary
hypertension
due
to
ASD
had
already
been
present
before
the
corrective
surgery
and
it
was
progressively
aggravated
without
improvement
after
the
correction
of
the
shunt
up
to
the
current
admission
.
Therefore,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
had
been
continuously
compressed,
in
spite
of
the
post-closure
status
for
ASD
.
We
could
rule
out
the
other
possible
reasons
for
the
negative
results
of
the
serologic
tests
for
syphilis,
other
rheumatoid
diseases
and
the
absence
of
other
manifestations
of
systemic
vasculitis
.
The
reason
for
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
ascending
aorta
and
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
considered
to
be
an
extrinsic
compression
owing
to
extremely
dilated
pulmonary
artery
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
In
stenosis
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery,
as
the
mortality
rate
of
patients
without
surgical
treatment
is
high15-RRB-,
aorto-coronary
artery
bypass
is
absolutely
indicated6-RRB-
.
In
our
case,
however,
the
left
coronary
artery,
including
the
left
main
artery,
was
fully
visualized
with
collaterals
of
grade
III
from
the
right
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
4,
5-RRB-
which
explains
that
she
seldom
suffered
from
angina
.
It
is
possible
to
say
that
long-standing,
slowly
progressive
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
occlusion
induces
the
development
of
sufficient
collateral
circulation
without
severe
myocardial
ischemia
.
Fijiwara
et
al7-RRB-
suggested
that
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
improved
or
disappeared
after
ASD
closure,
thanks
to
normalization
of
pulmonary
flow
.
That
means
if
the
pulmonary
hypertension
is
reversible,
aorto-coronary
bypass
may
be
unnecessary
.
However,
in
our
experience,
the
reversibility
of
the
narrowing
of
the
left
coronary
artery
was
not
only
determined
by
the
ASD
closure
but
also
by
the
time
of
the
closure
.
The
narrowing
of
the
left
coronary
artery
may
not
be
relieved
after
operation,
if
it
is
performed
too
late
like
our
case
.
We
concluded,
in
agreement
with
previous
reported
cases47-RRB-,
that
the
dilated
pulmonary
artery
trunk
due
to
ASD
associated
with
pulmonary
hypertension
can
be
a
possible
cause
of
left
main
coronary
artery
occlusion
and
that,
if
the
ASD
closure
was
too
late,
the
narrowing
or
occlusion
of
the
left
coronary
artery
could
not
be
resolved,
even
after
operation,
owing
to
irreversible
pulmonary
hypertension
.
Three
new
species
of
Angiosperms
have
been
found
in
four
short
collection
trips
to
the
same
protected
reserveEstao
Ecolgica
Estadual
de
Wenceslau
Guimaresand
neighboring
areas
in
the
Atlantic
Forest
in
the
south
of
the
Brazilian
state
of
Bahia
.
These
new
species
belong
to
three
genera
from
three
distinct
lineages
in
the
family
Melastomataceae:
Huberia,
Meriania
and
Physeterostemon
.
The
description
of
these
species
represent
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
i.e.,
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
about
the
biodiversity
in
the
area,
as
well
as
in
tropical
forests
as
a
whole
.
The
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both
genetic
and
morphological-RRB-
stock,
and
thus
is
also
valuable
as
a
phylogenetic
conservation
priority
.
Introduction
Studies
on
biodiversity
and
evolutionary
biology
have
been
traditionally
hindered
by
gaps
in
basic,
natural
history
knowledge,
no
matter
what
kind
of
methods
or
organisms
they
deal
with
.
These
shortfalls
can
be
linked
to
the
lack
of
taxonomic
work,
i.e.,
species
descriptions
-LRB-Linnean
shortfall;
Brown
&
Lomolino,
1998;
Whittaker
et
al.,
2005-RRB-
or
absence
of
data
regarding
their
distribution
-LRB-Wallacean
shortfall;
Bini
et
al.,
2006-RRB-
.
Both
lead
to
a
third
gap
in
our
knowledge:
the
lack
of
information
on
phylogenetic
relationships,
and
thus
the
evolutionary
history
of
life
on
Earth
-LRB-i.e.,
Darwinian
shortfall,
Diniz-Filho
et
al.,
2013-RRB-
.
The
forests
of
eastern
Brazil
-LRB-Atlantic
Forest
or
Mata
Atlntica-RRB-
harbor
an
incredible
amount
of
biodiversity,
and
are
considered
one
of
the
biodiversity
hotspots
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000-RRB-
.
With
less
than
10%
of
the
original
vegetation
remaining,
the
Atlantic
Forest
is
also
a
high
conservation
priority
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000;
Ribeiro
et
al.,
2009-RRB-
.
Our
knowledge
about
biodiversity
in
this
area
is
not
static
as
inventories
of
angiosperms
have
shown
.
In
2009
the
list
of
flowering
plants
from
the
Atlantic
Forest
contained
ca
13,700
species
-LRB-Stehmann
et
al.,
2009-RRB-,
while
the
most
recent
account
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
includes
ca
15,000
species
.
In
both
cases
4949.5%
of
the
species
are
reported
as
endemic
.
This
1,300
species
increase
within
six
years
is
mainly
due
to
the
participation
of
specialists
for
most
plant
families
and
the
heavy
use
of
new
informatic
tools
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
.
However,
this
increase
also
includes
new
species
being
described
at
a
steady
rate
.
In
a
16
year
span
-LRB-19902006-RRB-,
1,194
species
of
angiosperms
were
described
for
the
Atlantic
Forest
-LRB-Sobral
&
Stehmann,
2009-RRB-,
which
represents
an
increase
of
about
80
species
per
year
.
Taking
the
total
13,700
species
surveyed
in
2009,
this
means
that
almost
8.7%
of
these
species
were
described
in
the
previous
15
years
.
This
high
species
description
rate
of
angiosperms
has
been
more
intense
in
the
middle
section
of
Atlantic
Forest
from
southern
Bahia
trough
Esprito
Santo
and
North
Eastern
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
The
forests
in
that
range
are
very
rich
for
both
plants
-LRB-Martini
et
al.,
2007;
Leitman
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
animals
-LRB-Carnaval
&
Moritz,
2008;
Carnaval
et
al.,
2009;
Silva
et
al.,
2012-RRB-
.
Moreover,
these
areas
have
been
historically
poorly
collected,
and
thus
lesser
known
than
the
southern
portions
of
Atlantic
Forest
in
So
Paulo,
Paran
and
Santa
Catarina,
and
central
and
western
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
Recent
collection
efforts,
especially
in
medium
to
high
altitudes
have
yielded
several
new
species
-LRB-for
Melastomataceae
only:
Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009;
Goldenberg
&
Reginato,
2009;
Baumgratz,
Amorim
&
Jardim,
2011;
Reginato,
Baumgratz
&
Goldenberg,
2013;
Amorim,
Jardim
&
Goldenberg,
2014-RRB-
.
This
was
also
the
case
for
our
four
short,
34-day
collection
trips
to
small
area
within
the
municipality
of
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
southern
Bahia
.
These
trips
provided
enough
material
for
the
description
of
three
new
species
of
Melastomataceae,
from
three
different
genera:
Huberia
DC.,
Meriania
Sw
.
and
Physeterostemon
R
Goldenb
.
&
Amorim
.
These
genera
belong
to
distinct
lineages,
respectively
the
Merianthera
clade
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2012-RRB-,
tribe
Merianieae
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
Miconieae/Eriocnema
clade
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009-RRB-
.
Huberia
has
16
species,
most
of
them
from
eastern
Brazil
except
for
four
species
found
in
the
Andes
in
Peru
and
Ecuador
-LRB-Baumgratz,
2004-RRB-
.
Meriania
has
95110
species,
ranging
from
southern
Mexico
and
Caribbean
to
Bolivia
and
southeastern
Brazil
-LRB-Michelangeli,
Carmenate-Reyes
&
Sosa,
2015-RRB-
.
Physeterostemon
has
four
species,
all
endemic
to
southern
Bahia
-LRB-Amorim,
Jardim
&
Goldenberg,
2014-RRB-
.
The
discovery
of
three
distantly
related
species
in
the
same
family
and
in
the
same
area
underscores
our
lack
of
knowledge
for
several
groups
and
areas
of
the
tropics
.
It
is
important
to
emphasize
that
every
one
of
the
three
species
described
here
has
characters
that
are
unique
within
their
respective
lineages
-LRB-see
discussions
below-RRB-,
thus
the
discovery
of
these
new
species
goes
beyond
that
of
adding
to
species
to
groups
and
areas,
but
also
greatly
add
to
our
knowledge
of
morphological
diversity
and
evolution
for
each
of
the
three
genera
.
Moreover,
some
of
the
groups
described
in
the
last
10
years
represent
key
lineages
heretofore
unknown
.
An
example
is
Physeterostemon
-LRB-Goldenberg
&
Amorim,
2006-RRB-,
first
described
from
two
species
from
southern
Bahia,
and
that
turned
out
to
represent
the
sister
group
of
the
Miconieae
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009-RRB-,
an
exclusively
Neotropical
group
with
ca
2,000
species
.
The
description
of
the
species
here
is
as
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
because
three
new
species
from
a
single
family
are
found
in
the
same
place,
disclosing
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
regarding
the
biodiversity
of
the
area
.
As
for
conservation
purposes,
the
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both
genetic
and
morphological-RRB-
stock
-LRB-Vane-Wright,
Humphries
&
Williams,
1991;

&
May,
1997;
Sechrest
et
al.,
2002;
Hidasi-Neto,
Loyola
&
Cianciaruso,
2013-RRB-,
and
thus
is
also
valuable
as
a
phylogenetic
conservation
priority
.

is
contained
within
a

municipality,
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
the
southern

of
the

of

-LRB-Fig

The
area
surrounding
the

has
been
almost
entirely
logged
and
cleared
.
It
is
nowadays
covered
with
small
rural
properties,

the
agricultural
activities
are
based
mostly
on
cocoa,
fruticulture
-LRB-mostly
soursop,
locally
called
graviola,
and
sold
as
frozen
pulp-RRB-
and
subsistence
crops

Some
areas
inside
the
reserve
has
been
cleared
and
used
for
agricultural
purposes
for
a
long
time
up
to
the
1990s,
but
now
there
are
no
families
living
in
it
anymore
.
Apart
from
some
areas
covered
with
secondary
vegetation,
mostly
on

Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
sessile
leaves,
which
are
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
this
species
.
Remarks
.
All
species
of
Huberia
known
to
date
have
petiolate
leaves,
with
bases
ranging
from
cuneate
and
decurrent
to
obtuse
to
rounded
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-
.
No
described
species
present
the
sessile
leaves
with
subcordate
to
cordate
bases
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
The
character
combination
of
short
sepals
and
short
connective
appendages
can
be
found
in
H
glazioviana
Cogn
.
and
H
consimilis
Baumgratz
.
However
in
these
species
the
connective
appendage
ranges
from
1.5
to
4
mm
long
in
the
former,
and
1.3
to
4.7
mm
long
in
the
latter
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-,
thus
usually
longer
than
the
1.31.7
mm
long
ones
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
Apart
from
the
petiolate
leaves
with
acute
to
obtuse
bases,
H
glazioviana
also
differ
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
pubescent
branches
and
leaves,
while
H
consimilis
differs
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
longer
-LRB-up
to
24
mm
long-RRB-
and
slenderer
pedicels

Meriania
inflata
is
known
from
only
one
collection
from
forests
within
the
Estao
Ecolgica
Estadual
Wenceslau
Guimares
in
southern
Bahia
.
At
the
time
of
collecting
the
type
specimen
three
individuals
were
observed
.
Given
the
size
of
the
reserve
-LRB-24.2
km2-RRB-
and
potential
habitat,
we
recommend
that
Meriania
inflata
is
given
a
status
of
critically
endangered
-LRB-IUCN,
2014-RRB-
.
Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
two
inflated
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
.
This
character
occurs
in
both
Meriania
inflata
and
Meriania
tetramera,
and
makes
these
two
species
very
distinctive
among
other
species
of
Meriania
.
Remarks
.
Among
the
Eastern
Brazilian
species
of
Meriania,
the
indument
and
anther
morphology
of
M
inflata
are
very
similar
to
those
of
M
tetramera
-LRB-Chiavegatto,
2009;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2008;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-
.
This
anther
morphology
with
paired
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
is
not
known
in
any
other
species
in
the
genus
apart
from
M
inflata
and
M
tetramera
.
This
feature
is
undoubtedly
associated
with
the
pollination
biology
of
these
species,
but
nothing
is
known
about
the
natural
history
of
either
species
.
While
Meriania
tetramera
also
has
greenish
petals
and
plinerved
leaves,
the
two
species
can
be
readily
distinguished
because
Meriania
tetramera
has
4-merous
flowers
and
a
calyx
closed
in
bud
that
opens
irregularly
.
The
leaf
and
hypanthium
indument
of
M
inflata
is
also
similar
to
that
of
M
calophylla
-LRB-Naudin-RRB-
Triana
.
However,
M
calophylla
has
narrower
leaves
that
are
basally-nerved,
much
larger
flowers
with
purple
to
lavender
petals
at
anthesis,
and
dimorphic
stamens
with
dorsal
ascending
appendages
.
In
the
recent
key
to
Brazilian
Meriania
-LRB-Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-,
M
inflata
would
not
fit
either
of
the
options
in
the
first
couplet
as
the
inflorescences
are
pendulous
or
deflexed
-LRB-as
in
M
glazioviana

and
M
longipes

but

.
To
address
this
issue
we
obtained
tibia
quantitative
computed
tomography
scans
from
103
patients
age
5-21
years
with
CKD
-LRB-26
on

at
baseline
and
12
months
later
.
Gender,
ethnicity,

and/or
age-specific
Z-scores
were
generated
for
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD,
cortical
area,
periosteal

circumference,
and
muscle
area
based
on
over
700

subjects
.
Muscle
area,
cortical
area,
and
periosteal

Z-scores
were
significantly
lower
at
baseline
compared
to
the
reference
cohort
.
Cortical
BMD,
cortical
area
and
periosteal
Z-scores
all
exhibited
a
significant
further
decrease
over
12
months
.
Higher
parathyroid
hormone
levels
were
associated
with
significantly
greater
increases
in

BMD
and
decreases
in
cortical
BMD
in
younger
patients
-LRB-significant

.
The
estimated
GFR
was
not
associated
with
changes

of
parathyroid
hormone
.
Changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
were
significantly
and
positively
associated
in
control
subjects
but
not
in
CKD
patients
.
Thus,
children
and
adolescents
with
CKD
have
progressive
cortical
bone
deficits
related
to
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
and
potential
impairment
of
the
functional
muscle-bone
unit
.
Interventions
are
needed
to
enhance
bone
accrual
in
childhood-onset
CKD
.
Introduction
Children
with
chronic
kidney
disease
-LRB-CKD-RRB-
have
multiple
risk
factors
for
impaired
bone
accrual,
including
poor
growth,
delayed
maturation,
muscle
deficits,
decreased
physical
activity,
abnormal
mineral
metabolism
and
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
.
We
recently
reported
that
childhood-onset
CKD
was
associated
with
significant
deficits
in
cortical
volumetric
bone
mineral
density
-LRB-BMD-RRB-,
cortical
dimensions
and
muscle
area,
as
measured
by
peripheral
quantitative
computed
tomography
-LRB-pQCT-RRB-.1,
2
CKD
was
also
associated
with
elevated
trabecular
BMD
in
younger
participants
only
.
The
cross-sectional
design
limited
the
assessment
of
determinants
of
bone
abnormalities
and
associations
between
bone
and
muscle
outcomes
.
To
our
knowledge,
longitudinal
studies
of
bone
accrual
in
childhood
CKD,
in
the
absence
of
intervening
renal
transplantation,
are
limited
to
series
of
7-18
participants.3-6
These
studies
were
further
limited
by
the
use
of
dual
energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
-LRB-DXA-RRB-
measures
of
areal
BMD
.
DXA
is
a
two-dimensional
projection
technique
that
obscures
distinct
CKD
effects
on
trabecular
and
cortical
bone,7
and
underestimates
volumetric
BMD
in
children
with
growth
failure.8
The
objectives
of
this
prospective
cohort
study
were:
1-RRB-
to
assess
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD
and
cortical
dimensions
over
a
one
year
interval
in
children
and
adolescents
with
mild
to
severe
CKD,
2-RRB-
to
identify
correlates
of
changes
in
pQCT
parameters
including
CKD
progression,
intact
parathyroid
hormone
-LRB-iPTH-RRB-
levels,
and
medications,
and
3-RRB-
to
assess
the
relations
between
changes
in
muscle
area
and
bone
dimensions
-LRB-the
functional
muscle-bone
unit-RRB-
compared
with
longitudinal
data
in
healthy
reference
participants
.

Trabecular
BMD
Overall,
trabecular
BMD
Z-scores
did
not
change
significantly
in
all
participants
combined,
or
within
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
groups
.
The
multivariate
regression
model
for
changes
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
demonstrated
that
a
greater
mean
iPTH
level
was
associated
with
a
significantly
greater
change
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
-LRB-p<0.001-RRB-
and
this
effect
was
limited
to
the
younger

.
These
results
are

according
to

Changes
in

were
significantly
greater
in
the
11

that
had
elevated

only,
compared
to
the
47
without
elevated

-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
.
Similar
results
were
obtained
in
the

.
Lower

eGFR
was
associated
with
greater
increases
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
-LRB-p<0.03-RRB-
and
analyses
stratified
on

suggested
this

was
more
pronounced
in
the

.
The

in

was
eliminated
when
the

Cortical

In
the
multivariate

were
associated
with
greater

and
this

was
marginally
greater
in

.
Among
participants
<
14

a

greater
than
the

was
associated
with
a

Discussion
This
is
the
first
study
to
examine
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD,
cortical
dimensions,
muscle
area
and
muscle
strength
in
childhood
CKD
.
Secondary
hyperparathyroidism
in
CKD
was
associated
with
greater
increases
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-scores
and
greater
declines
in
cortical
BMD
Z-scores
in
younger
participants
.
Cortical
BMD,
cortical
area,
and
periosteal
circumference
Z-scores
decreased
significantly
over
one
year
.
The
positive
association
between
changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
Z-scores
observed
in
reference
participants
was
absent
in
CKD
.
Prior
longitudinal
bone
imaging
studies
in
children
with
CKD
were
limited
to
DXA
and
quantitative
ultrasound
methods.3-6
These
studies
were
further
limited
by
small
sample
sizes
and
inadequate
reference
data
.
Longitudinal
studies
using
pQCT
in
CKD
are
limited
to
two
radius
studies
in
older
adults:
Obatake
et
al
reported
decreases
in
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD
over
one
year
in
53
pre-dialysis
patients
-LRB-mean
age
61
years-RRB-.14
Fujimore
et
al
reported
decreases
in
cortical
BMD
and
cortical
bone
area
over
two
years
in
53
hemodialysis
patients
-LRB-mean
age
67
years-RRB-.15
Given
the
absence
of
reference
participants,
it
is
not
known
if
these
changes
were
greater
than
expected
with
aging
.
The
association
between
hyperparathyroidism
and
increased
trabecular
BMD
in
younger
children
with
CKD
has
been
described
in
prior
cross-sectional
studies,2,
10,
16-19
and
confirmed
in
this
longitudinal
study
.
We
hypothesized
that
the
elevated
trabecular
BMD
in
the
younger
children
was
due
to
iPTH
and
CKD
effects
at
the
metaphysis,
with
impaired
resorption
of
the
dense
metaphyseal
spongiosa.20
Our
prior
cross-sectional
study
demonstrated
an
inverse
association
between
iPTH
levels
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD
across
all
ages;
however,
this
longitudinal
study
only
detected
this
association
in
younger
participants
.
The
study
by
Obatake
et
al
failed
to
show
an
association
between
iPTH
levels
and
changes
in
cortical
BMD
while
the
study
by
Fujimore
et
al
detected
an
inverse
association
in
males
only.14,
15
Periosteal
and
endosteal
circumference
both
increased
with
higher
mean
levels
of
iPTH
in
our
study
.
The
increase
in
periosteal
circumference
is
consistent
with
prior
human
and
animal
studies
of
PTH
therapy.21,
22
The
increase
in
endosteal
circumference
is
consistent
with
a
study
of
bone
biopsies
in
adult
dialysis
patients,
demonstrating
that
hyperparathyroidism
was
associated
with
endocortical
resorption.23
The
European
guidelines
advise
lower
target
PTH
levels,
compared
with
KDOQI
.
The
observation
that
PTH
levels
above
the
European
target
-LRB-but
within
the
KDOQI
target
range-RRB-
were
associated
with
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD,
compared
with
participants
that
were
not
above
the
European
target
provides
preliminary
support
for
these
lower
targets.12
Prior
studies
have
shown
variable
results
with
different
PTH
assay
methods;
24
however,
our
study
used
the
same
assay
throughout
and
confirmed
the
results
using
the
bioactive
1-84
PTH
level
.
This
study
demonstrated
that
concurrent
rhGH
therapy
was
associated
with
preservation
of
section
modulus
Z-scores
and
greater
declines
in
fat
area
Z-scores
.
However,
the
results
must
be
interpreted
with
caution
given
the
small
number
of
participants
treated
with
rhGH
and
our
failure
to
detect
significant
associations
with
changes
in
periosteal
and
endosteal
circumference
or
muscle
area
Z-scores
.
To
our
knowledge
pediatric
CKD
BMD
studies
of
growth
hormone
therapy
are
limited
to
DXA
imaging
.
5,
6,
25-27
These
studies
yielded
conflicting
results,
likely
due
to
variable
reference
data,
and
adjustments
for
short
stature
and
intercurrent
growth
.
None
of
these
studies
examined
volumetric
BMD
or
cortical
dimensions
.
In
contrast,
a
radius
pQCT
study
by
Schweizer
et
al28,
in
prepubertal
children
with
growth
hormone
deficiency
demonstrated
that
cortical
total
area
-LRB-a
measure
of
periosteal
dimensions-RRB-
increased
significantly
relative
to
height
age;
marrow
area
-LRB-a
measure
of
endosteal
dimensions-RRB-
and
cortical
area
did
not
change
significantly
after
one
year
of
rhGH
therapy
.
This
is
consistent
with
our
observation
that
rhGH
was
associated
with
improvements
in
cortical
dimensions
.
Larger
controlled
studies
are
needed
to
establish
rhGH
effects
on
bone
accrual
in
CKD
.
The
longitudinal
data
in
our
pediatric
CKD
cohort
demonstrated
significant
and
worsening
cortical
area
deficits
over
one
year
.
Given
the
strong
association
between
cortical
bone
strength
and
muscle
mass
during
normal
growth
-LRB-Figure
2A-RRB-,
we
examined
the
associations
between
cortical
bone
and
muscle
area
.
The
positive
association
was
absent
in
CKD
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
This
may
be
explained
by
lower
muscle
force
relative
to
muscle
area
in
CKD
13,
29
and
less
physical
activity.30,
31
Prior
studies
have
demonstrated
muscle
abnormalities
including
muscle
atrophy,
myopathy,
and
reduced
physical
functioning
in
pediatric
dialysis
patients.19,
32
Prior
pQCT
studies
in
adults
with
pre-dialysis
CKD33,
and
those
on
maintenance
hemodialysis34
demonstrated
that
decreased
cortical
thickness
and
BMD
were
significantly
associated
with
greater
odds
of
fracture
.
While
the
sample
size
is
inadequate
to
address
age,
sex,
and
skeletal
site
specific
fracture
rates,
it
is
noteworthy
that
6
of
103
CKD
participants
had
a
fracture
during
the
study
interval
.
This
rate
is
higher
than
observed
in
healthy
pediatric
population-based
studies
at
any
age
in
males
or
females.35
The
wide
spectrum
of
underlying
renal
disease
and
duration,
and
differences
in
participant
treatment
characteristics
is
a
significant
limitation
of
this
study
.
The
study
included
participants
with
conditions
and
medications
that
can
impact
bone
health,
including
glucocorticoids,
calcineurin
inhibitors
and
rhGH
.
Furthermore,
the
majority
of
dialysis
participants
had
a
history
of
prior
allograft
failure
.
The
subgroup
analyses
had
limited
power
and
we
were
unable
to
define
associations
between
disease
characteristics
and
changes
in
bone
outcomes
.
Therefore,
the
results
should
be
considered
with
caution
and
used
to
generate
hypotheses
for
future
studies
.
A
second
limitation
is
the
lack
of
bone
biopsy
data,
precluding
measures
of
trabecular
bone
microarchitecture,
turnover
or
mineralization
.
The
term
CKD-Mineral
and
Bone
Disorder
-LRB-CKD-MBD-RRB-
describes
a
broad
systemic
disorder
of
mineral
and
bone
metabolism,
as
well
as
vascular
and
soft-tissue
calcification.36
We
were
also
unable
to
address
extra-skeletal
calcification
.
A
final
limitation
is
the
lack
of
measures
of
FGF-23
.
However,
a
recent
bone
biopsy
study
reported
that
FGF-23
levels
were
not
associated
with
defective
mineralization.37
Given
that
a
recent
biopsy
study
in
52
children
with
pre-dialysis
CKD
reported
evidence
of
defective
mineralization
in
29%
of
patients
with
stage
2,
42%
with
stage
3,
and
79%
with
stage
4/5
CKD,
future
studies
comparing
QCT
scans
and
bone
biopsies
are
needed
to
determine
the
sensitivity
of
QCT
to
identify
mineralization
defects.37
The
study
design
has
multiple
important
strengths
.
It
is
the
largest
longitudinal
bone
study
of
childhood
onset
CKD
and
the
first
to
use
pQCT
to
quantify
changes
in
bone
and
muscle
.
It
included
a
large
robust
longitudinal
reference
sample
permitting
adjustment
for
age,
sex,
race,
tibia
length
and
muscle
area
in
the
assessment
of
bone
outcomes
.
Furthermore
the
use
of
Z-scores
for
volumetric
BMD,
cortical
dimensions,
and
muscle
deficits
provide
the
first
evidence
of
the
clinical
magnitude
of
the
deficits
.
We
recently
compared
DXA
and
pQCT
results
in
a
cross-sectional
analyses
of
88
participants.38
While
pQCT
measures
of
trabecular
BMD
were
associated
with
DXA
measures
of
lumbar
spine
BMD
-LRB-R2=0.13-RRB-
and
pQCT
measures
of
cortical
bone
mineral
content
were
associated
with
DXA
whole
body
bone
mineral
content
-LRB-R2=0.41-RRB-,
DXA
measures
were
not
associated
with
iPTH
levels
.
Therefore,
the
clinical
utility
of
DXA
remains
unproven
.
In
summary,
our
data
demonstrated
that
children
and
adolescents
with
CKD
have
progressive
declines
in
cortical
bone
accrual
at
one
year
follow-up,
partially
related
to
hyperparathyroidism
and
muscle
deficits
.
Future
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
fracture
implications
of
these
findings,
and
to
identify
therapies
to
enhance
bone
quality
in
children
with
CKD
.
Materials
and
Methods
Study
participants
The
study
cohort
consisted
of
children
and
adolescents
aged
5-21
years
with
CKD
-LRB-baseline
eGFR
<
90
ml/min/1.73m2-RRB-
enrolled
in
a
larger
study
of
bone
health
in
CKD
at
Children's
Hospital
of
Philadelphia
-LRB-CHOP-RRB-
and
Cincinnati
Children's
Hospital
and
Medical
Center
-LRB-CCHMC-RRB-.1,
2,
38-40
Patients
were
ineligible
for
this
study
if
they
had
a
history
of
chronic
conditions
unrelated
to
CKD
that
may
impact
bone
health
or
had
a
functioning
renal
allograft
.
This
study
population
was
compared
to
a
reference
population
of
903
healthy
children
and
adolescents
from
CHOP
recruited
from
general
pediatric
practices
in
the
greater
Philadelphia
area.2,
10
Reference
participants
were
excluded
for
medical
history
of
illness
or
medications
that
could
affect
growth
and
development
.
A
total
of
269
completed
a
12
month
visit
in
a
longitudinal
substudy.10,
41
Study
approval
was
obtained
from
the
Institutional
Review
Boards
at
CHOP
and
CCHMC
.
Informed
consent
was
obtained
directly
from
study
patients
18
years
of
age,
and
assent
as
well
as
parental
consent
in
those
<
18
years
of
age
.
Anthropometry,
Sexual
Maturity
and
Race
Height
was
measured
using
a
stadiometer
-LRB-Holtain,
Crymych,
UK-RRB-
and
weight
with
a
digital
scale
-LRB-Scaletronix,
White
Plains,
New
York-RRB-
.
Tibia
length
was
measured
with
a
segmometer
.
Pubertal
development
was
assessed
using
a
self-assessment
questionnaire
and
classified
according
to
Tanner
stage.42,
43
Participant's
race
was
categorized
by
parents
or
the
participant
according
to
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
categories
.
Physical
Activity
Questionnaire
The
physical
activity
questionnaire
was
designed
to
assess
biomechanical
impact.10,
44,
45
The
questionnaire
was
introduced
mid-study
in
the
reference
participants
and
completed
in
401
participants
.
CKD
Disease
Characteristics
and
Medications
Medical
charts
were
reviewed
for
the
date
of
diagnosis,
cause
of
underlying
renal
disease,
fracture
history,
medications,
and
dialysis
and
transplant
history
.
Underlying
renal
disease
was
categorized
as
congenital
anomalies
of
the
kidney
and
urinary
tract
-LRB-CAKUT-RRB-,
FSGS,
systemic
inflammatory
disease
and
other
.
All
fracture
events
during
the
study
were
confirmed
by
review
of
radiology
reports
.
Peripheral
Quantitative
Computed
Tomography
Bone,
muscle
and
fat
measures
were
obtained
in
the
left
tibia
using
a
Stratec
XCT2000
pQCT
device
-LRB-Orthometrix,
White
Plains,
NY-RRB-
.
Scan
parameters,
software
and
calibration
procedures
have
been
described.2,
10
Bone
measurements
were
obtained
at
the
3%
metaphyseal
site
for
trabecular
volumetric
BMD
-LRB-mg/cm3-RRB-
and
at
the
38%
diaphyseal
site
for
cortical
volumetric
BMD,
-LRB-mg/cm3-RRB-,
periosteal
and
endosteal

-LRB-mm-RRB-,
cortical
cross
sectional
area
-LRB-mm2-RRB-,
and
polar
section
modulus
-LRB-mm3-RRB-
.
Fat
and
muscle
area
-LRB-mm3-RRB-
were
assessed
66%
proximal
to
the
distal
physis
.
The
manufacturer's
hydroxyapatite
phantom
was
scanned
daily
.
In
our
laboratory,
the
coefficient
of
variation
-LRB-CV-RRB-
ranged
from
0.5
to
1.6%
for
pQCT
outcomes
in
children
and
adolescents
.
Measurement
of
Muscle
Force
Muscle
force
in
ankle
dorsiflexion
was
assessed
using
isometric
dynamometry
-LRB-Biodex
Medical
Systems,
Inc,
Shirley,
NY-RRB-.46
The
Biodex
measures
were
performed
in
280
reference
participants
and
in
the
CKD
participants
at
the
baseline
and
12
month
follow-up
visit
at
CHOP
only
.
Laboratory
Measurements
Non-fasting
blood
chemistries
and
iPTH
were
measured
at
baseline,
6
and
12
months
in
non-dialysis
participants
and
baseline,
3,
6,
and
12
months
in
dialysis
participants
.
Serum
bicarbonate
-LRB-mmol/L-RRB-,
calcium
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-,
phosphorus
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-,
and
albumin
-LRB-g/dL-RRB-
concentrations
were
measured
in
clinical
laboratories
using
standard
methods
and
calcium
levels
were
adjusted
for
albumin
levels.47
Plasma
PTH
-LRB-pg/ml-RRB-
was
measured
using
two
different
immunoradiometric
assays
-LRB-IRMA-RRB-
with
I125I-
labeled
tracer
-LRB-Scantibodies
Clinical
Laboratory,
Santee,
CA,
USA-RRB-
.
The
traditional
second
generation
IRMA
measured
iPTH
.
The
third
generation
assay
used
a
specific
polyclonal
PTH
antibody
directed
against
the
most
N-terminal
PTH
region
as
tracer
antibody
in
order
to
measure
the
bioactive
1-84
PTH
molecule
.
The
intra-assay
CV
for
the
intact
and
bioactive
PTH
assays
were
3
to
5%
and
3
to
10%
respectively
.
48
Serum
creatinine
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-
was
measured
by
spectrophotometric
enzymatic
assay
-LRB-Vitros,
Johnson
&
Johnson
Co,
Rochester,
NY-RRB-
with
a
CV
of
1%
to
5%
.
Estimated
GFR
-LRB-ml/min/1.73m2-RRB-
was
calculated
based
on
height
and
serum
creatinine
using
the
pediatric
estimating
equation
from
the
Chronic
Kidney
Disease
in
Children
prospective
cohort
study
49
.
CKD
stage
was
classified
according
to
National
Kidney
Foundation
guidelines.50
Dialysis
patients
were
assigned
an
eGFR
of
7.5
ml/min/1.73m2
for
models
examining
baseline
eGFR
as
a
continuous
variable,
and
for
calculating
change
in
eGFR
in
the
two
participants
that
started
dialysis
during
the
study
.
Statistical
Analysis
Analysis
were
performed
using
Stata
11.0
-LRB-Stata
Corp.,
College
Station,
TX,
USA-RRB-
.
A
p
value
<
0.05
was
considered
statistically
significant
and
two
sided
tests
of
hypotheses
were
used
throughout
.
Continuous
variables
were
expressed
as
means
SD
or
median
-LRB-IQR-RRB-
if
not
normally
distributed
.
Group
differences
were
assessed
using
Student's
t
test
or
the
Wilcoxon
rank
sum
test
.
Changes
within
the
CKD
patients
were
tested
using
the
paired
t-test
or
the
Wilcoxon
signed
rank
test
.
Differences
in
proportions
were
tested
using
the
chi-square
test
.
Correlations
between
continuous
variables
were
assessed
by
Pearson
or
Spearman's
correlations
.
Although
this
study
included
multiple
comparison,
we
did
not
apply
a
Bonferroni
correction
because
this
assumes
the
multiple
outcomes
are
independent.51
The
majority
of
bone
and
muscle
Z-score
were
highly
correlated
.
Rather,
we
evaluated
the
results
for
internal
consistency
and
interpreted
isolated
results
with
caution
.
Age-
and
sex-
specific
height
and
BMI
Z-scores
were
calculated
using
national
data
.
52
All
PTH
levels
were
log
transformed
and
a
mean
value
created
for
each
individual
over
the
study
interval,
and
used
in
the
longitudinal
models
.
The
pQCT
outcomes
were
converted
to
race
and
sex
specific
Z-scores
using
the
LMS
method
based
on
the
reference
participants,
as
described.2,
10,
53,
54
This
method
accounts
for
the
non-linearity,
heteroscedasticity
and
skew
of
bone
data
during
growth.55,
56
Trabecular
and
cortical
BMD
were
assessed
relative
to
age
.
Cortical
geometry,
muscle
and
fat
outcomes
were
correlated
with
tibia
length
-LRB-all
p<0.0001-RRB-;
therefore,
the
Z-scores
were
generated
relative
to
tibia
length
and
further
adjusted
for
age
and
tibia
length
using
linear
regression
analyses
.
Changes
in
pQCT
Z-scores
within
the
CKD
participants
were
annualized
-LRB-change
per
12
months-RRB-
and
assessed
using
multivariate
regression
models
.
Given
the
differences
in
disease
and
participant
characteristics
in
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
participants,
we
stratified
the
annualized
changes
in
bone
outcomes
-LRB-Table
3-RRB-
.
However,
the
associations
between
changes
in
bone
outcomes
and
exposure
variables
did
not
differ
between
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
participants
.
Therefore,
multivariate
regression
models
of
changes
examined
the
entire
cohort
together
.
The
following
covariates
were
tested
for
each
pQCT
outcome-
baseline
outcome
Z-score,
study
location,
age,
sex,
race,
Tanner
stage,
disease
characteristics,
concurrent
medications,
and
baseline
and
change
values
for
eGFR
and
physical
activity
.
Bone
models
also
included
mean
iPTH
levels
.
All
of
the
models
that
included
the
iPTH
covariate
were
repeated
using
1-84
or
7-84
PTH
levels,
yielding
the
same
results
-LRB-data
not
shown-RRB-
.
The
correlations
between
iPTH,
1-84
PTH
and
7-84
PTH
exceeded
0.98;
therefore
it
was
not
possible
to
assess
independent
associations
.
The
1-84/7-84
ratio
was
not
significant
in
any
longitudinal
models
.
Secondary
analyses
were
performed
comparing
pQCT
Z-scores
in
participants
that
were
above
the
European
iPTH
target
but
within
KDOQI
target
range,
vs
those
without
elevated
iPTH
by
either
target
.
The
associations
between
changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
Z-scores
were
compared
in
the
CKD
participants
and
the
longitudinal
subset
of
reference
participants
using
multivariable
regression
analysis
.
Models
for
peak
muscle
torque
were
compared
in
the
CKD
and
reference
participants
adjusted
for
age,
sex,
race,
tibia
length
and
muscle
area.57
