A
34-year-old
woman
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
of
recently
aggravated
right
heart
failure
without
angina
for
5
months
.
When
she
was
25
years
old,
patch
repair
with
Polytetrafluoroethylene
-LRB-PTFE-RRB-
was
performed
for
the
secondum
type
of
atrial
septal
defect
-LRB-ASD-RRB-
with
moderate
pulmonary
hypertension
.
The
chest
PA,
echocardiography
and
cardiac
catheterization
at
current
admission
revealed
Eisenmenger
syndrome
without
intracardiac
shunt
.
Chest
CT
scan
with
contrast
revealed
markedly
dilated
pulmonary
trunk,
both
pulmonary
arteries
and
concave
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
of
the
ascending
aorta
suggesting
extrinsic
compression,
as
well
as
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
that
was
retrogradly
filled
with
collateral
circulation
from
the
right
coronary
artery
.
The
coronary
angiography
showed
normal
right
coronary
artery
and
the
collaterals
that
come
out
from
the
conus
branch
to
the
mid-left
anterior
descending
artery
-LRB-LAD-RRB-
and
that
from
distal
right
coronary
artery
to
the
left
circumflex
artery
-LRB-LCX-RRB-
and
to
the
distal
LAD,
respectively
.
On
aortography,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
not
visualized
with
no
stump,
suggestive
of
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
.
From
our
experience,
it
is
possible
to
say
that
the
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
can
be
induced
by
the
dilated
pulmonary
artery
trunk
due
to
ASD
with
pulmonary
hypertension
and
that,
if
the
ASD
closure
was
too
late,
the
narrowing
or
obstruction
of
the
left
coronary
artery
could
not
be
resolved
even
after
operation
owing
to
irreversible
pulmonary
hypertension
.
INTRODUCTION
Atrial
septal
defect
in
the
middle-aged
and
elderly,
which
is
associated
with
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery,
usually
induces
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
in
cases
of
un-correction
or
delayed
corrective
surgery13-RRB-
.
Furthermore,
the
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
is
associated
with
hemodynamic
compromise
of
the
left
ventricle
and
sudden
cardiac
death
due
to
the
collapse
of
systemic
circulation
.
However,
the
causes
of
sudden
death
in
the
patient
with
severe
pulmonary
hypertension
have
remained
uncertain
.
Among
the
causes
of
death,
the
failure
of
coronary
circulation
might
be
one
of
the
causes
.
In
this
case,
we
reviewed
total
occlusion
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
caused
by
extrinsic
compression
of
the
markedly
dilated
main
pulmonary
trunk47-RRB-
that
was
induced
by
progressive
pulmonary
hypertension
due
to
delayed
closure
of
the
atrial
septal
defect
.
CASE
A
34-year-old
woman
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
of
recently
aggravated
dyspnea,
general
edema
and
abdominal
distension
for
5
months
.
In
her
past,
she
had
no
history
of
Kawasaki
disease
during
childhood
.
However,
nine
years
before
admission,
patch
repair
with
PTFE
was
performed
for
the
secondum
type
of
atrial
septal
defect
-LRB-ASD-RRB-
.
Thereafter,
she
had
been
managed
for
pulmonary
hypertension
and
aggravating
right
heart
failure
.
The
preoperative
values
collected
from
her
past
medical
records
of
the
previous
hospital
included
pulmonary/systolic
flow
ratio
-LRB-Qp/Qs-RRB-
of
2:1,
pulmonary/systolic
resistance
ratio
-LRB-Rp/Rs-RRB-
of
0.35,
pulmonary
arterial
systolic
pressure
-LRB-PASP-RRB-
of
51
mmHg
and
the
diameter
of
main
pulmonary
artery
of
40
mm,
which
were
suggestive
of
significant
left
to
right
shunt
with
moderate
pulmonary
hypertension,
and
normal
coronary
artery
.
As
the
PASP
during
the
postoperative
care
was
not
decreased
to
the
normal
range,
the
doctor
who
operated
on
the
patient
cautioned
and
wrote
on
her
record
of
the
possibility
of
progressing
pulmonary
hypertension
.
On
admission,
blood
pressure
and
pulse
rate
were
110/70
mmHg
and
85
beats
per
minute,
respectively
.
On
physical
examination,
there
were
engorged
neck
vein,
soft
abdominal
distension,
palpable
liver,
and
pretibial
pitting
edema
.
Systolic
murmur
of
grade
III/VI
was
auscultated
from
her
lower
sternal
border
.
The
arterial
blood
gas
analysis
showed
pO2
of
77.4
mmHg,
pCo2
of
31.2
mmHg
under
the
room
air
.
The
rheumatoid
factor
-LRB-RF-RRB-
and
VDRL
for
syphilis
were
both
negative
.
The
electrocardiogram
revealed
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
incomplete
right
bundle
branch
block
and
biventricular
hypertrophy
.
The
chest
PA
showed
markedly
enlarged
cardiac
size
with
prominently
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery
and
centralization
of
pulmonary
hilum,
suggesting
pulmonary
arterial
hypertension
-LRB-Figure
1-RRB-
.
Echocardiogram
with
Doppler
study
demonstrated
right
ventricular
hypertrophy,
D-shape
left
ventricle,
as
well
as
severe
pulmonary
and
tricuspid
regurgitation,
which
corresponded
to
right
ventricular
systolic
pressure
of
117
mmHg
.
However,
there
was
no
intracardiac
shunt
remained
on
color
interrogation
.
Moreover,
serial
echocardiographic
evaluation
had
revealed
the
progression
of
pulmonary
hypertension
after
delivery
of
her
baby
.
A
diagnosis
of
Eisenmenger
syndrome
was
made
.
The
base-line
study
for
heart-lung
transplantation,
including
chest
computed
tomography
-LRB-CT-RRB-,
cardiac
catheterization
and
coronary
angiography
were
undertaken
.
Chest
CT
scan
with
contrast
revealed
markedly
dilated
pulmonary
trunk
and
both
pulmonary
arteries
-LRB-Figure
2A-RRB-,
a
concave
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
of
the
ascending
aorta
and
nearly
total
occlusion
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
that
was
retrogradly
filled
with
collateral
circulation
from
the
right
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
That
was
suggestive
of
compression
of
the
left
side
of
the
aorta
and
the
left
main
coronary
artery
together
by
the
pulmonary
trunk
passing
by
the
ascending
aortas
left
side
.
Cardiac
catheterization
revealed
PASP
of
105
mmHg,
Qp/Qs
of
1
and
Rp/Rs
of
1.4
-LRB-Figure
3-RRB-,
which
mean
no
remaining
shunt
but
much
aggravated
pulmonary
hypertension
compatible
with
Eisenmenger
syndrome
compared
with
preoperative
data
.
The
coronary
angiography
showed
normal
right
coronary
artery
and
the
collaterals
that
came
out
from
the
conus
branch
to
mid-left
anterior
descending
artery
-LRB-LAD-RRB-
and
that
from
the
distal
right
coronary
artery
to
the
left
circumflex
artery
-LRB-LCX-RRB-
and
to
the
distal
LAD,
respectively
-LRB-Figure
4,
5-RRB-
.
Engagement
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
with
the
diagnostic
coronary
catheter
was
not
available
.
On
aortography,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
not
visualized
with
no
stump,
suggesting
total
occlusion
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
6-RRB-
.
There
was
no
other
luminal
lesion
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
coronary
artery
system
and
the
thoracic
as
well
as
the
abdominal
aorta
.
DISCUSSION
Some
adults
with
congenital
heart
disease
have
associated
ischemic
heart
disease3,
8-RRB-
.
On
the
other
hand,
atherosclerosis9-RRB-,
syphilis10-RRB-,
aortitis11,
12-RRB-
and
congenital
anomalies
of
the
coronary
artery1314-RRB-
are
widely-known
causes
of
stenosis
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
.
Compression
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
has
not
been
widely
known
.
However,
in
1957,
Corday,
et
al.4-RRB-
first
pointed
out
that
the
distended
main
pulmonary
artery
easily
compressed
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
because
of
the
spatial
position
of
the
proximal
part
of
the
left
coronary
artery
closed
to
the
main
pulmonary
artery
.
Schaffer,
et
al.5-RRB-
tried
to
prove
the
correlation
between
pulmonary
pressure
and
coronary
flow
at
autopsy
which,
however,
was
unsuccessful
because
the
main
pulmonary
artery
of
the
autopsied
heart
was
not
sufficiently
dilated
.
Mitsudo
et
al.6-RRB-
first
reported
the
case
of
a
female
patient
with
ASD
that
was
combined
with
severe
narrowing
of
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
on
angiography
.
After
the
patient
died
suddenly,
the
postmortem
examination
confirmed
no
anatomic
or
pathological
abnormality
of
the
coronary
arteries
.
Also,
they
reported
that,
in
adults
with
ASD
and
pulmonary
hypertension,
the
coronary
angiography
revealed
localized
concave
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
orifice
in
7
-LRB-44%-RRB-
of
16
patients
.
In
patients
without
pulmonary
hypertension,
however,
these
findings
were
not
observed
.
Fijiwara
et
al.7-RRB-
reported
3
cases
of
adult
ASD
with
compression
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
by
dilated
main
pulmonary
artery
.
In
one
patient
of
the
three,
magnetic
resonance
imaging
study
demonstrated
that
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
ran
close
to
the
left
main
pulmonary
artery
so
that
the
markedly
distended
pulmonary
artery
easily
compressed
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
.
In
two
of
the
three
cases,
one
case
died
because
of
septicemia
after
closure
of
ASD,
the
narrowed
left
main
coronary
artery
was
no
longer
narrowed
or
improved
the
severity
of
narrowing
after
closure
of
ASD
.
In
our
case,
pulmonary
hypertension
due
to
ASD
had
already
been
present
before
the
corrective
surgery
and
it
was
progressively
aggravated
without
improvement
after
the
correction
of
the
shunt
up
to
the
current
admission
.
Therefore,
the
left
main
coronary
artery
had
been
continuously
compressed,
in
spite
of
the
post-closure
status
for
ASD
.
We
could
rule
out
the
other
possible
reasons
for
the
negative
results
of
the
serologic
tests
for
syphilis,
other
rheumatoid
diseases
and
the
absence
of
other
manifestations
of
systemic
vasculitis
.
The
reason
for
disfigurement
of
the
left
side
ascending
aorta
and
the
ostium
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
was
considered
to
be
an
extrinsic
compression
owing
to
extremely
dilated
pulmonary
artery
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
In
stenosis
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery,
as
the
mortality
rate
of
patients
without
surgical
treatment
is
high15-RRB-,
aorto-coronary
artery
bypass
is
absolutely
indicated6-RRB-
.
In
our
case,
however,
the
left
coronary
artery,
including
the
left
main
artery,
was
fully
visualized
with
collaterals
of
grade
III
from
the
right
coronary
artery
-LRB-Figure
4,
5-RRB-
which
explains
that
she
seldom
suffered
from
angina
.
It
is
possible
to
say
that
long-standing,
slowly
progressive
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
artery
occlusion
induces
the
development
of
sufficient
collateral
circulation
without
severe
myocardial
ischemia
.
Fijiwara
et
al7-RRB-
suggested
that
narrowing
of
the
left
main
coronary
trunk
improved
or
disappeared
after
ASD
closure,
thanks
to
normalization
of
pulmonary
flow
.
That
means
if
the
pulmonary
hypertension
is
reversible,
aorto-coronary
bypass
may
be
unnecessary
.
However,
in
our
experience,
the
reversibility
of
the
narrowing
of
the
left
coronary
artery
was
not
only
determined
by
the
ASD
closure
but
also
by
the
time
of
the
closure
.
The
narrowing
of
the
left
coronary
artery
may
not
be
relieved
after
operation,
if
it
is
performed
too
late
like
our
case
.
We
concluded,
in
agreement
with
previous
reported
cases47-RRB-,
that
the
dilated
pulmonary
artery
trunk
due
to
ASD
associated
with
pulmonary
hypertension
can
be
a
possible
cause
of
left
main
coronary
artery
occlusion
and
that,
if
the
ASD
closure
was
too
late,
the
narrowing
or
occlusion
of
the
left
coronary
artery
could
not
be
resolved,
even
after
operation,
owing
to
irreversible
pulmonary
hypertension
.
Three
new
species
of
Angiosperms
have
been
found
in
four
short
collection
trips
to
the
same
protected
reserveEstao
Ecolgica
Estadual
de
Wenceslau
Guimaresand
neighboring
areas
in
the
Atlantic
Forest
in
the
south
of
the
Brazilian
state
of
Bahia
.
These
new
species
belong
to
three
genera
from
three
distinct
lineages
in
the
family
Melastomataceae:
Huberia,
Meriania
and
Physeterostemon
.
The
description
of
these
species
represent
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
i.e.,
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
about
the
biodiversity
in
the
area,
as
well
as
in
tropical
forests
as
a
whole
.
The
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both
genetic
and
morphological-RRB-
stock,
and
thus
is
also
valuable
as
a
phylogenetic
conservation
priority
.
Introduction
Studies
on
biodiversity
and
evolutionary
biology
have
been
traditionally
hindered
by
gaps
in
basic,
natural
history
knowledge,
no
matter
what
kind
of
methods
or
organisms
they
deal
with
.
These
shortfalls
can
be
linked
to
the
lack
of
taxonomic
work,
i.e.,
species
descriptions
-LRB-Linnean
shortfall;
Brown
&
Lomolino,
1998;
Whittaker
et
al.,
2005-RRB-
or
absence
of
data
regarding
their
distribution
-LRB-Wallacean
shortfall;
Bini
et
al.,
2006-RRB-
.
Both
lead
to
a
third
gap
in
our
knowledge:
the
lack
of
information
on
phylogenetic
relationships,
and
thus
the
evolutionary
history
of
life
on
Earth
-LRB-i.e.,
Darwinian
shortfall,
Diniz-Filho
et
al.,
2013-RRB-
.
The
forests
of
eastern
Brazil
-LRB-Atlantic
Forest
or
Mata
Atlntica-RRB-
harbor
an
incredible
amount
of
biodiversity,
and
are
considered
one
of
the
biodiversity
hotspots
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000-RRB-
.
With
less
than
10%
of
the
original
vegetation
remaining,
the
Atlantic
Forest
is
also
a
high
conservation
priority
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000;
Ribeiro
et
al.,
2009-RRB-
.
Our
knowledge
about
biodiversity
in
this
area
is
not
static
as
inventories
of
angiosperms
have
shown
.
In
2009
the
list
of
flowering
plants
from
the
Atlantic
Forest
contained
ca
13,700
species
-LRB-Stehmann
et
al.,
2009-RRB-,
while
the
most
recent
account
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
includes
ca
15,000
species
.
In
both
cases
4949.5%
of
the
species
are
reported
as
endemic
.
This
1,300
species
increase
within
six
years
is
mainly
due
to
the
participation
of
specialists
for
most
plant
families
and
the
heavy
use
of
new
informatic
tools
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
.
However,
this
increase
also
includes
new
species
being
described
at
a
steady
rate
.
In
a
16
year
span
-LRB-19902006-RRB-,
1,194
species
of
angiosperms
were
described
for
the
Atlantic
Forest
-LRB-Sobral
&
Stehmann,
2009-RRB-,
which
represents
an
increase
of
about
80
species
per
year
.
Taking
the
total
13,700
species
surveyed
in
2009,
this
means
that
almost
8.7%
of
these
species
were
described
in
the
previous
15
years
.
This
high
species
description
rate
of
angiosperms
has
been
more
intense
in
the
middle
section
of
Atlantic
Forest
from
southern
Bahia
trough
Esprito
Santo
and
North
Eastern
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
The
forests
in
that
range
are
very
rich
for
both
plants
-LRB-Martini
et
al.,
2007;
Leitman
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
animals
-LRB-Carnaval
&
Moritz,
2008;
Carnaval
et
al.,
2009;
Silva
et
al.,
2012-RRB-
.
Moreover,
these
areas
have
been
historically
poorly
collected,
and
thus
lesser
known
than
the
southern
portions
of
Atlantic
Forest
in
So
Paulo,
Paran
and
Santa
Catarina,
and
central
and
western
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
Recent
collection
efforts,
especially
in
medium
to
high
altitudes
have
yielded
several
new
species
-LRB-for
Melastomataceae
only:
Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009;
Goldenberg
&
Reginato,
2009;
Baumgratz,
Amorim
&
Jardim,
2011;
Reginato,
Baumgratz
&
Goldenberg,
2013;
Amorim,
Jardim
&
Goldenberg,
2014-RRB-
.
This
was
also
the
case
for
our
four
short,
34-day
collection
trips
to
small
area
within
the
municipality
of
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
southern
Bahia
.
These
trips
provided
enough
material
for
the
description
of
three
new
species
of
Melastomataceae,
from
three
different
genera:
Huberia
DC.,
Meriania
Sw
.
and
Physeterostemon
R
Goldenb
.
&
Amorim
.
These
genera
belong
to
distinct
lineages,
respectively
the
Merianthera
clade
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2012-RRB-,
tribe
Merianieae
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
Miconieae/Eriocnema
clade
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg

Huberia
has
16
species,
most
of
them
from
eastern
Brazil
except
for
four
species
found
in
the
Andes
in
Peru
and
Ecuador
-LRB-Baumgratz,
2004-RRB-
.
Meriania
has
95110
species,
ranging
from
southern
Mexico
and
Caribbean
to
Bolivia
and
southeastern
Brazil
-LRB-Michelangeli,
Carmenate-Reyes
&
Sosa,
2015-RRB-
.
Physeterostemon
has
four
species,
all
endemic
to
southern
Bahia
-LRB-Amorim,
Jardim
&
Goldenberg,
2014-RRB-
.
The
discovery
of
three
distantly
related
species
in
the
same
family
and
in
the
same
area
underscores
our
lack
of
knowledge
for
several
groups
and
areas
of
the
tropics
.
It
is
important
to
emphasize
that
every
one
of
the
three
species
described
here
has
characters
that
are
unique
within
their
respective
lineages
-LRB-see
discussions
below-RRB-,
thus
the
discovery
of
these
new
species
goes
beyond
that
of
adding
to
species
to
groups
and
areas,
but
also
greatly
add
to
our
knowledge
of
morphological
diversity
and
evolution
for
each
of
the
three
genera
.
Moreover,
some
of
the
groups
described
in
the
last
10
years
represent
key
lineages
heretofore
unknown
.
An
example
is
Physeterostemon
-LRB-Goldenberg
&
Amorim,
2006-RRB-,
first
described
from
two
species
from
southern
Bahia,
and
that
turned
out
to
represent
the
sister
group
of
the
Miconieae
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009-RRB-,
an
exclusively
Neotropical
group
with
ca
2,000
species
.
The
description
of
the
species
here
is
as
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
because
three
new
species
from
a
single
family
are
found
in
the
same
place,
disclosing
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
regarding
the
biodiversity
of
the
area
.
As
for
conservation
purposes,
the
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both

and

thus

Study
Area
The
Estao
Ecolgica
Estadual
de
Wenceslau
Guimares
-LRB-EEEWG-RRB-
was
created
in
1997
and
enlarged
in
2000,
totaling
2,418
hectares
-LRB-Bahia,
2010-RRB-
.
The
reserve
is
contained
within
a
single
municipality,
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
state
of
Bahia,
Brazil
-LRB-Fig
1-RRB-
.
Its
geomorphology
includes
deep
and
straight
valleys
200500
m
wide,
at
550
m
elevation
at
the
lowest
point,
and
enclosed
by
mountains
up
to
1,000
m
elevation,
with
slopes
ranging
mostly
between
15
and
50
.
The
soils
are
mostly
alic
Oxisols,
but
there
are
also
Lithic
Psamments
and
Ultisols
.
The
climate
is
tropical
and
humid,
but
some
slopes
facing
west
can
be
considered
as
sub-humid
.
The
annual
mean
temperature
ranges
between
22
and
25.5
C,
and
rainfall
between
800
and
1,500
mm
-LRB-Bahia,
2010-RRB-
.
The
area
surrounding
the
reserve
has
been
almost
entirely
logged
and
cleared
.
It
is
nowadays
covered
with
small
rural
properties,
and
the
agricultural
activities
are
based
mostly
on
cocoa,
fruticulture
-LRB-mostly
soursop,
locally
called
graviola,
and
sold
as
frozen
pulp-RRB-
and
subsistence
crops
.
Some
areas
inside
the
reserve
has
been
cleared
and
used
for
agricultural
purposes
for
a
long
time
up
to
the
1990s,
but
now
there
are
no
families
living
in
it
anymore
.
Apart
from
some
areas
covered
with
secondary
vegetation,
mostly
on
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
and
lower
slopes,
the
reserve
is
covered
with
sub-montane
tropical
moist
forest

A
species
of
Huberia
that
differs
from
all
other
species
in
the
genus
due
to
the
sessile
leaves
with
subcordate
to
cordate
bases,
short
-LRB-11.3

sepals,
and
the
connective

Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
sessile
leaves,
which
are
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
this
species
.
Remarks
.
All
species
of
Huberia
known
to
date
have
petiolate
leaves,
with
bases
ranging
from
cuneate
and
decurrent
to
obtuse
to
rounded
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-
.
No
described
species
present
the
sessile
leaves
with
subcordate
to
cordate
bases
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
The
character
combination
of
short
sepals
and
short
connective
appendages
can
be
found
in
H
glazioviana
Cogn
.
and
H
consimilis
Baumgratz
.
However
in
these
species
the
connective
appendage
ranges
from
1.5
to
4
mm
long
in
the
former,
and
1.3
to
4.7
mm
long
in
the
latter
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-,
thus
usually
longer
than
the
1.31.7
mm
long
ones
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
Apart
from
the
petiolate
leaves
with
acute
to
obtuse
bases,
H
glazioviana
also
differ
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
pubescent
branches
and
leaves,
while
H
consimilis
differs
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
longer
-LRB-up

24

and
slenderer

Meriania
inflata
is
known
from
only
one
collection
from
forests
within
the
Estao
Ecolgica
Estadual
Wenceslau
Guimares
in
southern
Bahia
.
At
the
time
of
collecting
the
type
specimen
three
individuals
were
observed
.
Given
the
size
of
the
reserve
-LRB-24.2
km2-RRB-
and
potential
habitat,
we
recommend
that
Meriania
inflata
is
given
a
status
of
critically
endangered
-LRB-IUCN,
2014-RRB-
.
Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
two
inflated
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
.
This
character
occurs
in
both
Meriania
inflata
and
Meriania
tetramera,
and
makes
these
two
species
very
distinctive
among
other
species
of
Meriania
.
Remarks
.
Among
the
Eastern
Brazilian
species
of
Meriania,
the
indument
and
anther
morphology
of
M
inflata
are
very
similar
to
those
of
M
tetramera
-LRB-Chiavegatto,
2009;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2008;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-
.
This
anther
morphology
with
paired
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
is
not
known
in
any
other
species
in
the
genus
apart
from
M
inflata
and
M
tetramera
.
This
feature
is
undoubtedly
associated
with
the
pollination
biology
of
these
species,
but
nothing
is
known
about
the
natural
history
of
either
species
.
While
Meriania
tetramera
also
has
greenish
petals
and
plinerved
leaves,
the
two
species
can
be
readily
distinguished
because
Meriania
tetramera
has
4-merous
flowers
and
a
calyx
closed
in
bud
that
opens
irregularly
.
The
leaf
and
hypanthium
indument
of
M
inflata
is
also
similar
to
that
of
M
calophylla
-LRB-Naudin-RRB-
Triana
.
However,
M
calophylla
has
narrower
leaves
that
are
basally-nerved,
much
larger
flowers
with
purple
to
lavender
petals
at
anthesis,
and
dimorphic
stamens
with
dorsal
ascending
appendages
.
In
the
recent
key
to
Brazilian
Meriania
-LRB-Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-,
M
inflata
would
not
fit
either
of
the
options
in
the
first
couplet
as
the
inflorescences
are
pendulous
or
deflexed
-LRB-as
in
M
glazioviana
Cogn
.
and
M
longipes
Triana-RRB-
but
the
peduncle
is
less
than
4
cm
long

disease
-LRB-CKD-RRB-
on
acquisition
of
volumetric
bone
mineral
density
-LRB-BMD-RRB-
and
cortical

is
lacking
.
To
address
this
issue
we
obtained
tibia
quantitative
computed
tomography
scans
from
103
patients
age
5-21
years
with
CKD
-LRB-26
on
dialysis-RRB-
at
baseline
and
12
months
later
.
Gender,
ethnicity,
tibia
length
and/or
age-specific
Z-scores
were
generated
for
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD,
cortical
area,
periosteal
and
endosteal
circumference,
and
muscle
area
based
on
over
700
reference
subjects
.
Muscle
area,
cortical
area,
and
periosteal
and
endosteal
Z-scores
were
significantly
lower
at
baseline
compared
to
the
reference
cohort
.
Cortical
BMD,
cortical
area
and
periosteal
Z-scores
all
exhibited
a
significant
further
decrease
over
12
months
.
Higher
parathyroid
hormone
levels
were
associated
with
significantly
greater
increases
in
trabecular
BMD
and
decreases
in
cortical
BMD
in
younger
patients
-LRB-significant
interaction
terms
for
trabecular
BMD
and
cortical
BMD-RRB-
.
The
estimated
GFR
was
not
associated
with
changes
in
BMD
Z-scores
independent
of
parathyroid
hormone
.
Changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
were
significantly
and
positively
associated
in
control
subjects
but
not
in
CKD
patients
.
Thus,
children
and
adolescents
with
CKD
have
progressive
cortical
bone
deficits
related
to
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
and
potential
impairment
of
the
functional
muscle-bone
unit
.
Interventions
are
needed
to
enhance
bone
accrual
in
childhood-onset
CKD
.
Introduction
Children
with
chronic
kidney
disease
-LRB-CKD-RRB-
have
multiple
risk
factors
for
impaired
bone
accrual,
including
poor
growth,
delayed
maturation,
muscle
deficits,
decreased
physical
activity,
abnormal
mineral
metabolism
and
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
.
We
recently
reported
that
childhood-onset
CKD
was
associated
with
significant
deficits
in
cortical
volumetric
bone
mineral
density
-LRB-BMD-RRB-,
cortical
dimensions
and
muscle
area,
as
measured
by
peripheral
quantitative
computed
tomography
-LRB-pQCT-RRB-.1,
2
CKD
was
also
associated
with
elevated
trabecular
BMD
in
younger
participants
only
.
The
cross-sectional
design
limited
the
assessment
of
determinants
of
bone
abnormalities
and
associations
between
bone
and
muscle
outcomes
.
To
our
knowledge,
longitudinal
studies
of
bone
accrual
in
childhood
CKD,
in
the
absence
of
intervening
renal
transplantation,
are
limited
to
series
of
7-18
participants.3-6
These
studies
were
further
limited
by
the
use
of
dual
energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
-LRB-DXA-RRB-
measures
of
areal
BMD
.
DXA
is
a
two-dimensional
projection
technique
that
obscures
distinct
CKD
effects
on
trabecular
and
cortical
bone,7
and
underestimates
volumetric
BMD
in
children
with
growth
failure.8
The
objectives
of
this
prospective
cohort
study
were:
1-RRB-
to
assess
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD
and
cortical
dimensions
over
a
one
year
interval
in
children
and
adolescents
with
mild
to
severe
CKD,
2-RRB-
to
identify
correlates
of
changes
in
pQCT
parameters
including
CKD
progression,
intact
parathyroid
hormone
-LRB-iPTH-RRB-
levels,
and
medications,
and
3-RRB-
to
assess
the
relations
between
changes
in
muscle
area
and
bone
dimensions
-LRB-the
functional
muscle-bone
unit-RRB-
compared
with
longitudinal
data
in
healthy
reference
participants
.
Results
Participant
Characteristics
This
report
describes
103
CKD
participants
with
two
pQCT
scans,
a
median
12.5
months
apart
-LSB-interquartile
range
-LRB-IQR-RRB-
12.1,
13.2-RSB-,
including
83
from
the
prior
cross-sectional
study.2
The
focus
of
this
study
is
determinants
of
changes
in
bone,
therefore,
this
cohort
includes
an
additional
20
participants
that
were
ineligible
for
the
prior
study
due
to
a
history
of
solid
organ
transplantation
.
All
prior
renal
transplant
recipients
in
this
study
were
on
dialysis;
median
interval
since
transplantation
of
5.1
-LRB-IQR

7.2-RRB-
years
and
a
median
interval
since
starting
dialysis
of
11
-LRB-IQR

56-RRB-
months
.
Baseline
characteristics
are
summarized
in
Table
1
.
The
reference
participants
have
been
described.2,
9,
10
Compared
with
the
non-dialysis
CKD,
dialysis
participants
were
significantly
older,
more
likely
to
be
of
black
race
and
more
likely
to
have
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
-LRB-FSGS-RRB-
.
Clinical
Course
Laboratory
results,
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
-LRB-eGFR-RRB-
and
medications
are
summarized
in
Table
2
.
There
was
a
significant
decline
in
renal
function
over
the
study
period
in
non-dialysis
CKD
participants
with
a
median
decrease
of
2
-LRB-IQR
-7
to
1-RRB-
ml/min/1.73m2
.
Two
participants
initiated
dialysis
.
Serum
iPTH
and
phosphorus
levels
increased
significantly
in
the
non-dialysis
population
.
The
proportion
of
non-dialysis
participants
above
the
normal
iPTH
range
-LRB->65
pg/ml-RRB-
increased
from
39
to
52%
over
the
study
.
The
mean
iPTH
was
above
the
pediatric
Kidney
Disease
Outcome

Initiative
-LRB-KDOQI-RRB-
CKD
stage-specific
target
range
in
32
-LRB-42%-RRB-
and
13
-LRB-50%-RRB-
of
non-dialysis

participants,
respectively,
and
above
the
lower
European
target
ranges
in
38
-LRB-49%-RRB-
and
18
-LRB-69%-RRB-,
respectively.11,
12
Among
the
20
participants
with
a
history
of
prior
transplantation,
7
received
glucocorticoids
and
9
received
calcineurin
inhibitors
during
the
study
period
.
The
remainder
of
participants
treated
with
glucocorticoids
had
a
diagnosis
of
FSGS,
systemic
inflammatory
disease
or
IgA
nephropathy
.
Six
CKD
participants
sustained
a
total
of
7
fractures
-LRB-1

Outcomes
Table

summarizes
pQCT
Z-scores
in
CKD
participants
.
Trabecular
BMD
Overall,
trabecular
BMD
Z-scores
did
not
change
significantly
in
all
participants
combined,
or
within
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
groups
.
The
multivariate
regression
model
for
changes
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
demonstrated
that
a
greater
mean
iPTH
level
was
associated
with
a
significantly
greater
change
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
-LRB-p<0.001-RRB-
and
this
effect
was
limited
to
the
younger
participants
-LRB-interaction,
p=0.001-RRB-,
adjusted
for
baseline
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
.
These
results
are
illustrated
in
Figure
1,
according
to
age
<
or
the
median
of
14
years
.
Changes
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-scores
were
significantly
greater
in
the
11
participants
that
had
elevated
iPTH
levels
by
European
targets
only,
compared
to
the
47
without
elevated
iPTH
by
either
target
-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
.
Similar
results
were
obtained
in
the
45
participants
above
both
targets
.
Lower
baseline
eGFR
was
associated
with
greater
increases
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
-LRB-p<0.03-RRB-
and
analyses
stratified
on
median
age
suggested
this
effect
was
more
pronounced
in
the
younger
participants
.
The
association
between
change
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-score
and
baseline
eGFR
was
eliminated
when
the
models
were
adjusted
for
mean
iPTH
levels
.
Changes
in
trabecular
BMD-Z

were
not
associated
with

Cortical
BMD
At
baseline,
cortical
BMD
Z-scores
were
not
significantly
lower
in
CKD
participants
vs
reference
participants
overall
-LRB-p=0.06-RRB-
.
Baseline
cortical
BMD
Z-scores
were
inversely
associated
with
baseline
iPTH
concentrations
in
CKD
participants
-LRB-r=-0.25,
p=0.01-RRB-
.
Cortical
BMD
Z-scores
decreased
significantly
within
all
participants
combined
-LRB-p=0.02-RRB-
.
In
the
multivariate
regression
model
of
changes
in
cortical
BMD
Z-score,
higher
mean
iPTH
levels
were
associated
with
greater
declines
in
cortical
BMD
Z-score
-LRB-p=0.02-RRB-
and
this
association
was
marginally
greater
in
the
younger
participants
-LRB-interaction
p=0.05-RRB-
.
Among
participants
<
14
years
of
age,
a
mean
iPTH
level
greater
than
the
KDOQI
target
range
was
associated
with
a
0.29
greater
decline
in
cortical
BMD
Z-score
compared
with
those
within
or
below
the
target
range
.
Declines
in
cortical
BMD
Z-scores
were
significantly
greater
in
the
11

Similar
results
were

in
the
CKD

-LRB-p>0.4-RRB-
.
Over
the
follow-up

decreased
significantly
within
non-dialysis
CKD
and
dialysis
participants
.
Periosteal

both
demonstrated
a

In

Z-scores
in

were
associated
with
the
expected
changes
in
cortical
Z-scores,
i.e
the

unit,13
the

Discussion
This
is
the
first
study
to
examine
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD,
cortical
dimensions,
muscle
area
and
muscle
strength
in
childhood
CKD
.
Secondary
hyperparathyroidism
in
CKD
was
associated
with
greater
increases
in
trabecular
BMD
Z-scores
and
greater
declines
in
cortical
BMD
Z-scores
in
younger
participants
.
Cortical
BMD,
cortical
area,
and
periosteal
circumference
Z-scores
decreased
significantly
over
one
year
.
The
positive
association
between
changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
Z-scores
observed
in
reference
participants
was
absent
in
CKD
.
Prior
longitudinal
bone
imaging
studies
in
children
with
CKD
were
limited
to
DXA
and
quantitative
ultrasound
methods.3-6
These
studies
were
further
limited
by
small
sample
sizes
and
inadequate
reference
data
.
Longitudinal
studies
using
pQCT
in
CKD
are
limited
to
two
radius
studies
in
older
adults:
Obatake
et
al
reported
decreases
in
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD
over
one
year
in
53
pre-dialysis
patients
-LRB-mean
age
61
years-RRB-.14
Fujimore
et
al
reported
decreases
in
cortical
BMD
and
cortical
bone
area
over
two
years
in
53
hemodialysis
patients
-LRB-mean
age
67
years-RRB-.15
Given
the
absence
of
reference
participants,
it
is
not
known
if
these
changes
were
greater
than
expected
with
aging
.
The
association
between
hyperparathyroidism
and
increased
trabecular
BMD
in
younger
children
with
CKD
has
been
described
in
prior
cross-sectional
studies,2,
10,
16-19
and
confirmed
in
this
longitudinal
study
.
We
hypothesized
that
the
elevated
trabecular
BMD
in
the
younger
children
was
due
to
iPTH
and
CKD
effects
at
the
metaphysis,
with
impaired
resorption
of
the
dense
metaphyseal
spongiosa.20
Our
prior
cross-sectional
study
demonstrated
an
inverse
association
between
iPTH
levels
and
cortical
volumetric
BMD
across
all
ages;
however,
this
longitudinal
study
only
detected
this
association
in
younger
participants
.
The
study
by
Obatake
et
al
failed
to
show
an
association
between
iPTH
levels
and
changes
in
cortical
BMD
while
the
study
by
Fujimore
et
al
detected
an
inverse
association
in
males
only.14,
15
Periosteal
and
endosteal
circumference
both
increased
with
higher
mean
levels
of
iPTH
in
our
study
.
The
increase
in
periosteal
circumference
is
consistent
with
prior
human
and
animal
studies
of
PTH
therapy.21,
22
The
increase
in
endosteal
circumference
is
consistent
with
a
study
of
bone
biopsies
in
adult
dialysis
patients,
demonstrating
that
hyperparathyroidism
was
associated
with
endocortical
resorption.23
The
European
guidelines
advise
lower
target
PTH
levels,
compared
with
KDOQI
.
The
observation
that
PTH
levels
above
the
European
target
-LRB-but
within
the
KDOQI
target
range-RRB-
were
associated
with
changes
in
trabecular
and
cortical
BMD,
compared
with
participants
that
were
not
above
the
European
target
provides
preliminary
support
for
these
lower
targets.12
Prior
studies
have
shown
variable
results
with
different
PTH
assay
methods;
24
however,
our
study
used
the
same
assay
throughout
and
confirmed
the
results
using
the
bioactive
1-84
PTH
level
.
This
study
demonstrated
that
concurrent
rhGH
therapy
was
associated
with
preservation
of
section
modulus
Z-scores
and
greater
declines
in
fat
area
Z-scores
.
However,
the
results
must
be
interpreted
with
caution
given
the
small
number
of
participants
treated
with
rhGH
and
our
failure
to
detect
significant
associations
with
changes
in
periosteal
and
endosteal
circumference
or
muscle
area
Z-scores
.
To
our
knowledge
pediatric
CKD
BMD
studies
of
growth
hormone
therapy
are
limited
to
DXA
imaging
.
5,
6,
25-27
These
studies
yielded
conflicting
results,
likely
due
to
variable
reference
data,
and
adjustments
for
short
stature
and
intercurrent
growth
.
None
of
these
studies
examined
volumetric
BMD
or
cortical
dimensions
.
In
contrast,

in
prepubertal
children
with
growth
hormone
deficiency
demonstrated
that
cortical
total
area
-LRB-a
measure
of
periosteal
dimensions-RRB-
increased
significantly
relative
to
height
age;
marrow
area
-LRB-a
measure
of
endosteal
dimensions-RRB-
and
cortical
area
did
not
change
significantly
after
one
year
of
rhGH
therapy
.
This
is
consistent
with
our
observation
that
rhGH
was
associated
with
improvements
in
cortical
dimensions
.
Larger
controlled
studies
are
needed
to
establish
rhGH
effects
on
bone
accrual
in
CKD
.
The
longitudinal
data
in
our
pediatric
CKD
cohort
demonstrated
significant
and
worsening
cortical
area
deficits
over
one
year
.
Given
the
strong
association
between
cortical
bone
strength
and
muscle
mass
during
normal
growth
-LRB-Figure
2A-RRB-,
we
examined
the
associations
between
cortical
bone
and
muscle
area
.
The
positive
association
was
absent
in
CKD
-LRB-Figure
2B-RRB-
.
This
may
be
explained
by
lower
muscle
force
relative
to
muscle
area
in
CKD
13,
29
and
less
physical
activity.30,
31
Prior
studies
have
demonstrated
muscle
abnormalities
including
muscle
atrophy,
myopathy,
and
reduced
physical
functioning
in
pediatric
dialysis
patients.19,
32
Prior
pQCT
studies
in
adults
with
pre-dialysis
CKD33,
and
those
on
maintenance
hemodialysis34
demonstrated
that
decreased
cortical
thickness
and
BMD
were
significantly
associated
with
greater
odds
of
fracture
.
While
the
sample
size
is
inadequate
to
address
age,
sex,
and
skeletal
site
specific
fracture
rates,
it
is
noteworthy
that
6
of
103
CKD
participants
had
a
fracture
during
the
study
interval
.
This
rate
is
higher
than
observed
in
healthy
pediatric
population-based
studies
at
any
age
in
males
or
females.35
The
wide
spectrum
of
underlying
renal
disease
and
duration,
and
differences
in
participant
treatment
characteristics
is
a
significant
limitation
of
this
study
.
The
study
included
participants
with
conditions
and
medications
that
can
impact
bone
health,
including
glucocorticoids,
calcineurin
inhibitors
and
rhGH
.
Furthermore,
the
majority
of
dialysis
participants
had
a
history
of
prior
allograft
failure
.
The
subgroup
analyses
had
limited
power
and
we
were
unable
to
define
associations
between
disease
characteristics
and
changes
in
bone
outcomes
.
Therefore,
the
results
should
be
considered
with
caution
and
used
to
generate
hypotheses
for
future
studies
.
A
second
limitation
is
the
lack
of
bone
biopsy
data,
precluding
measures
of
trabecular
bone
microarchitecture,
turnover
or
mineralization
.
The
term
CKD-Mineral
and
Bone
Disorder
-LRB-CKD-MBD-RRB-
describes
a
broad
systemic
disorder
of
mineral
and
bone
metabolism,
as
well
as
vascular
and
soft-tissue
calcification.36
We
were
also
unable
to
address
extra-skeletal
calcification
.
A
final
limitation
is
the
lack
of
measures
of
FGF-23
.
However,
a
recent
bone
biopsy
study
reported
that
FGF-23
levels
were
not
associated
with
defective
mineralization.37
Given
that
a
recent
biopsy
study
in
52
children
with
pre-dialysis
CKD
reported
evidence
of
defective
mineralization
in
29%
of
patients
with
stage
2,
42%
with
stage
3,
and
79%
with
stage
4/5
CKD,
future
studies
comparing
QCT
scans
and
bone
biopsies
are
needed
to
determine
the
sensitivity
of
QCT
to
identify
mineralization
defects.37
The
study
design
has
multiple
important
strengths
.
It
is
the
largest
longitudinal
bone
study
of
childhood
onset
CKD
and
the
first
to
use
pQCT
to
quantify
changes
in
bone
and
muscle
.
It
included
a
large
robust
longitudinal
reference
sample
permitting
adjustment
for
age,
sex,
race,
tibia
length
and
muscle
area
in
the
assessment
of
bone
outcomes
.
Furthermore
the
use
of
Z-scores
for
volumetric
BMD,
cortical
dimensions,
and
muscle
deficits
provide
the
first
evidence
of
the
clinical
magnitude
of
the
deficits
.
We
recently
compared
DXA
and
pQCT
results
in
a
cross-sectional
analyses
of
88
participants.38
While
pQCT
measures
of
trabecular
BMD
were
associated
with
DXA
measures
of
lumbar
spine
BMD
-LRB-R2=0.13-RRB-
and
pQCT
measures
of
cortical
bone
mineral
content
were
associated
with
DXA
whole
body
bone
mineral
content
-LRB-R2=0.41-RRB-,
DXA
measures
were
not
associated
with
iPTH
levels
.
Therefore,
the
clinical
utility
of
DXA
remains
unproven
.
In
summary,
our
data
demonstrated
that
children
and
adolescents
with
CKD
have
progressive
declines
in
cortical
bone
accrual
at
one
year
follow-up,
partially
related
to
hyperparathyroidism
and
muscle
deficits
.
Future
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
fracture
implications
of
these
findings,
and
to
identify
therapies
to
enhance
bone
quality
in
children
with
CKD
.
Materials
and
Methods
Study
participants
The
study
cohort
consisted
of
children
and
adolescents
aged
5-21
years
with
CKD
-LRB-baseline
eGFR
<
90
ml/min/1.73m2-RRB-
enrolled
in
a
larger
study
of
bone
health
in
CKD
at
Children's

of
Philadelphia
-LRB-CHOP-RRB-
and
Cincinnati
Children's
Hospital
and
Medical

-LRB-CCHMC-RRB-.1,
2,
38-40
Patients
were
ineligible
for
this
study
if
they
had
a
history
of
chronic
conditions
unrelated
to
CKD
that
may
impact
bone
health
or
had
a
functioning
renal
allograft
.
This
study
population
was
compared
to
a
reference
population
of
903
healthy
children
and
adolescents
from
CHOP
recruited
from
general
pediatric

in
the
greater
Philadelphia
area.2,
10
Reference
participants
were
excluded
for
medical
history
of
illness
or
medications
that
could
affect
growth
and
development
.
A
total
of
269
completed
a
12
month
visit
in
a
longitudinal
substudy.10,
41
Study
approval
was
obtained
from
the
Institutional

patients
18
years
of
age,
and
assent
as
well
as
parental
consent
in
those
<

-LRB-Holtain,
Crymych,
UK-RRB-
and
weight
with
a
digital

was
assessed
using
a
self-assessment
questionnaire
and
classified
according
to
Tanner

questionnaire
was
designed
to
assess
biomechanical
impact.10,
44,
45
The
questionnaire
was
introduced
mid-study
in
the
reference
participants
and
completed
in
401

.
CKD
Disease
Characteristics
and
Medications
Medical
charts
were
reviewed
for
the
date
of
diagnosis,
cause
of
underlying
renal
disease,
fracture
history,
medications,
and
dialysis
and

were
confirmed
by
review
of

measures
were
obtained
in
the
left

Bone
measurements
were
obtained
at
the
3%
metaphyseal
site
for
trabecular
volumetric
BMD
-LRB-mg/cm3-RRB-
and
at
the
38%

-LRB-mm3-RRB-
were
assessed
66%
proximal
to
the

physis
.
The
manufacturer's
hydroxyapatite
phantom
was
scanned
daily
.
In
our
laboratory,
the
coefficient
of
variation
-LRB-CV-RRB-
ranged
from
0.5
to
1.6%
for
pQCT
outcomes
in
children
and

.
Measurement
of
Muscle
Force
Muscle
force
in
ankle
dorsiflexion
was
assessed
using
isometric
dynamometry
-LRB-Biodex
Medical
Systems,
Inc,
Shirley,
NY-RRB-.46
The
Biodex
measures
were
performed
in
280
reference
participants
and
in
the
CKD
participants
at
the
baseline
and
12
month
follow-up
visit
at
CHOP
only
.
Laboratory
Measurements
Non-fasting
blood
chemistries
and
iPTH
were
measured
at
baseline,
6
and
12
months
in
non-dialysis
participants
and
baseline,
3,
6,
and
12
months
in
dialysis
participants
.
Serum
bicarbonate
-LRB-mmol/L-RRB-,
calcium
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-,
phosphorus
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-,
and
albumin
-LRB-g/dL-RRB-
concentrations
were
measured
in
clinical
laboratories
using
standard
methods
and
calcium
levels
were
adjusted
for
albumin
levels.47
Plasma
PTH
-LRB-pg/ml-RRB-
was
measured
using
two
different
immunoradiometric
assays
-LRB-IRMA-RRB-
with
I125I-
labeled
tracer
-LRB-Scantibodies
Clinical
Laboratory,
Santee,
CA,
USA-RRB-
.
The
traditional
second
generation
IRMA
measured
iPTH
.
The
third
generation
assay
used
a
specific
polyclonal
PTH
antibody
directed
against
the
most
N-terminal
PTH
region
as
tracer
antibody
in
order
to
measure
the
bioactive
1-84
PTH
molecule
.
The
intra-assay
CV
for
the
intact
and
bioactive
PTH
assays
were
3
to
5%
and
3
to
10%
respectively
.
48
Serum
creatinine
-LRB-mg/dL-RRB-
was
measured
by
spectrophotometric
enzymatic
assay
-LRB-Vitros,
Johnson

Johnson
Co,
Rochester,
NY-RRB-
with
a
CV
of
1%
to
5%
.
Estimated
GFR
-LRB-ml/min/1.73m2-RRB-
was
calculated
based
on
height
and
serum
creatinine
using
the
pediatric
estimating
equation
from
the
Chronic
Kidney
Disease
in
Children
prospective
cohort
study
49
.
CKD
stage
was
classified
according
to
National
Kidney
Foundation
guidelines.50
Dialysis
patients
were
assigned
an
eGFR
of
7.5
ml/min/1.73m2
for
models
examining
baseline
eGFR
as
a
continuous
variable,
and
for
calculating
change
in
eGFR
in
the
two
participants
that
started
dialysis
during
the
study
.
Statistical
Analysis
Analysis
were
performed
using
Stata
11.0
-LRB-Stata
Corp.,
College
Station,
TX,
USA-RRB-
.
A
p
value
<
0.05
was
considered
statistically
significant
and
two
sided
tests
of
hypotheses
were
used
throughout
.
Continuous
variables
were
expressed
as
means
SD
or
median
-LRB-IQR-RRB-
if
not
normally
distributed
.
Group
differences
were
assessed
using
Student's
t
test
or
the
Wilcoxon
rank
sum
test
.
Changes
within
the
CKD
patients
were
tested
using
the
paired
t-test
or
the
Wilcoxon
signed
rank
test
.
Differences
in
proportions
were
tested
using
the
chi-square
test
.
Correlations
between
continuous
variables
were
assessed
by
Pearson
or
Spearman's
correlations
.
Although
this
study
included
multiple
comparison,
we
did
not
apply
a
Bonferroni
correction
because
this
assumes
the
multiple
outcomes
are
independent.51
The
majority
of
bone
and
muscle
Z-score
were
highly
correlated
.
Rather,
we
evaluated
the
results
for
internal
consistency
and
interpreted
isolated
results
with
caution
.
Age-
and
sex-
specific
height
and
BMI
Z-scores
were
calculated
using
national
data
.
52
All
PTH
levels
were
log
transformed
and
a
mean
value
created
for
each
individual
over
the
study
interval,
and
used
in
the
longitudinal
models
.
The
pQCT
outcomes
were
converted
to
race
and
sex
specific
Z-scores
using
the
LMS
method
based
on
the
reference
participants,
as
described.2,
10,
53,
54
This
method
accounts
for
the
non-linearity,
heteroscedasticity
and
skew
of
bone
data
during
growth.55,
56
Trabecular
and
cortical
BMD
were
assessed
relative
to
age
.
Cortical
geometry,
muscle
and
fat
outcomes
were
correlated
with
tibia
length
-LRB-all
p<0.0001-RRB-;
therefore,
the
Z-scores
were
generated
relative
to
tibia
length
and
further
adjusted
for
age
and
tibia
length
using
linear
regression
analyses
.
Changes
in
pQCT
Z-scores
within
the
CKD
participants
were
annualized
-LRB-change
per
12
months-RRB-
and
assessed
using
multivariate
regression
models
.
Given
the
differences
in
disease
and
participant
characteristics
in
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
participants,
we
stratified
the
annualized
changes
in
bone
outcomes
-LRB-Table
3-RRB-
.
However,
the
associations
between
changes
in
bone
outcomes
and
exposure
variables
did
not
differ
between
the
non-dialysis
and
dialysis
participants
.
Therefore,
multivariate
regression
models
of
changes
examined
the
entire
cohort
together
.
The
following
covariates
were
tested
for
each
pQCT
outcome-
baseline
outcome
Z-score,
study
location,
age,
sex,
race,
Tanner
stage,
disease
characteristics,
concurrent
medications,
and
baseline
and
change
values
for
eGFR
and
physical
activity
.
Bone
models
also
included
mean
iPTH
levels
.
All
of
the
models
that
included
the
iPTH
covariate
were
repeated
using
1-84
or
7-84
PTH
levels,
yielding
the
same
results
-LRB-data
not
shown-RRB-
.
The
correlations
between
iPTH,
1-84
PTH
and
7-84
PTH
exceeded
0.98;
therefore
it
was
not
possible
to
assess
independent
associations
.
The
1-84/7-84
ratio
was
not
significant
in
any
longitudinal
models
.
Secondary
analyses
were
performed
comparing
pQCT
Z-scores
in
participants
that
were
above
the
European
iPTH
target
but
within
KDOQI
target
range,
vs
those
without
elevated
iPTH
by
either
target
.
The
associations
between
changes
in
muscle
and
cortical
area
Z-scores
were
compared
in
the
CKD
participants
and
the
longitudinal
subset
of
reference
participants
using
multivariable
regression
analysis
.
Models
for
peak
muscle
torque
were
compared
in
the
CKD
and
reference
participants
adjusted
for
age,
sex,
race,
tibia
length
and
muscle
area.57
.
Background
Trials
on
sling
exercise
-LRB-SE-RRB-,
commonly
performed
to
manage
chronic
low
back
pain
-LRB-LBP-RRB-,
yield
conflicting
results
.
This
study
aimed
to
review
the
effects
of
SE
on
chronic
LBP
.
Methods
The
randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
SE
with
other
treatments
or
no
treatment,
published
up
to
August
2013,
were
identified
by
electronic
searches
.
Primary
outcomes
were
pain,
function,
and
return
to
work
.
The
weighted
mean
difference
-LRB-WMD-RRB-
and
95%
confidence
interval
-LRB-CI-RRB-
were
calculated,
using
a
random-effects
model
.
Results
Risk
of
bias
was
rated
as
high
in
9
included
trials,
where
some
important
quality
components
such
as
blinding
were
absent
and
sample
sizes
were
generally
small
.
We
found
no
clinically
relevant
differences
in
pain
or
function
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise,
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapy,
or
in
addition
to
acupuncture
.
Based
on
two
trials,
SE
was
more
effective
than
thermomagnetic
therapy
at
reducing
pain
-LRB-short-term:
WMD
13.90,
95%
CI
22.19
to
5.62;
long-term:
WMD
26.20,
95%
CI
31.32
to
21.08-RRB-
and
improving
function
-LRB-short-term:
WMD
10.54,
95%
CI
14.32
to
6.75;
long-term:
WMD
25.75,
95%
CI
30.79
to
20.71-RRB-
.
In
one
trial
we
found
statistically
significant
differences
between
SE
and
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy
-LRB-meloxicam
combined
with
eperisone
hydrochloride-RRB-
but
of
borderline
clinical
relevance
for
pain
-LRB-short-term:
WMD
15.00,
95%
CI
19.64
to
10.36-RRB-
and
function
-LRB-short-term:
WMD
10.00;
95%
CI
13.70
to
6.30-RRB-
.
There
was
substantial
heterogeneity
among
the
two
trials
comparing
SE
and
thermomagnetic
therapy;
both
these
trials
and
the
trial
comparing
SE
with
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy
had
serious
methodological
limitations
.
Interpretation
Based
on
limited
evidence
from
2
trials,
SE
was
more
effective
for
LBP
than
thermomagnetic
therapy
.
Clinically
relevant
differences
in
effects
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise,
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy,
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapy,
or
in
addition
to
acupuncture
could
not
be
found
.
More
high-quality
randomized
trials
on
the
topic
are
warranted
.
Introduction
Low
back
pain
-LRB-LBP-RRB-
is
a
very
common
disorder
-LSB-1-RSB-,
with
approximately
84%
of
adults
experiencing
an
episode
of
LBP
at
some
point
during
their
lifetimes
-LSB-2-RSB-
and
variable
recurrence
rates
-LRB-5%
to
60%-RRB-
-LSB-3-RSB-
.
LBP,
identified
as
the
leading
disability
contributor
-LSB-4-RSB-,
may
result
in
a
reduced
level
of
physical
capacity
-LSB-5-RSB--LSB-9-RSB-,
negative
psychological
effects
-LSB-10-RSB--LSB-17-RSB-,
and
reduction
in
the
quality
of
life;
as
such,
LBP
is
one
of
the
most
common
reasons
that
patients
opt
to
undergo
health
care
-LSB-18-RSB-,
-LSB-19-RSB-
.
In
the
United
States,
back
pain-related
lost
productive
work
time
in
workers
aged
between
40
and
65
years
costs
employers
an
estimated
$7.40
billion
per
year
-LSB-20-RSB-;
and
an
estimated
$50
billion
is
spent
annually
on
LBP
treatments
-LSB-21-RSB-
.
In
Australia,
direct
medical
costs
associated
with
LBP
treatments
are
estimated
at
more
than
$1
billion
per
year,
with
additional
$8
billion
covering
indirect
expenses
-LSB-22-RSB-
.
Although
the
outcomes
for
many
individuals
with
first-episode
LBP
are
positive,
20%
of
these
cases
may
develop
into
chronic
LBP,
which
is
defined
as
a
chronic
condition
of
LBP
lasting
for
at
least
three
months
or
longer
-LSB-3-RSB-,
-LSB-23-RSB--LSB-26-RSB-
.
And
chronic
LBP
accounts
for
three-quarters
of
the
total
direct
and
indirect
costs
of
medical
care
and
lost
productivity
associated
with
LBP
-LSB-27-RSB-
.
Hence,
it
is
essential
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
treatment
of
chronic
LBP
.
In
clinical
guidelines,
exercise
therapy
is
considered
as
an
effective
treatment
to
reduce
self-reported
pain
and
improve
the
back
pain
specific
functional
status
of
participants
with
chronic
LBP
-LSB-28-RSB-
.
Sling
exercise
-LRB-SE-RRB-
is
a
specific
form
of
exercise
established
by
Meier
-LSB-29-RSB-
to
rehabilitate
professional
German
sportsmen
and
later
developed
by
Kirkesola
to
treat
motor
problems
-LSB-30-RSB-
.
SE
supports
or
suspends
the
pelvis
and
lower
extremities
in
a
sling,
and
allows
an
individual
to
use
his
or
her
body
weight
to
provide
resistance
-LSB-31-RSB-,
-LSB-32-RSB-
.
This
exercise
minimizes
the
use
of
global
muscles
without
pain
as
local
muscles
are
activated
.
This
procedure
can
be
performed
easily
by
using
a
sling
and
an
elastic
cord
to
offset
body
weight;
however,
this
procedure
is
difficult
when
an
unstable
surface
is
used
-LSB-31-RSB-
.
SE
has
been
claimed
to
reduce
pain,
normalize
muscle
response
patterns,
retrain
muscle
motor
units,
re-operate
inhibited
actions,
and
improve
damaged
postural
adjustment
abilities
-LSB-33-RSB-
.
Published
randomized
controlled
trials
-LRB-RCTs-RRB-
have
assessed
the
effects
of
SE
on
the
treatment
of
chronic
LBP
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
However,
RCTs
that
assess
the
effects
of
SE
compared
with
other
forms
of
exercise
on
self-reported
pain
in
patients
with
chronic
LBP
have
presented
conflicting
findings
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-35-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
.
In
some
of
these
studies,
no
differences
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
have
been
found
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
.
In
other
studies,
SE
exhibits
more
advantages
than
other
forms
of
exercise
-LSB-35-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-
.
Studies
examining
back
pain
specific
functional
status
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
have
also
yielded
inconsistent
results
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-
.
Some
studies
have
found
no
differences
between
patients
receiving
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-
.
The
remaining
trial
has
demonstrated
an
increased
improvement
in
patients
receiving
SE
-LSB-36-RSB-
.
In
two
randomized
trials,
in
which
SE
is
compared
with
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-,
one
trial
has
shown
that
pain
is
reduced
when
SE
is
used
-LSB-37-RSB-;
the
other
trial
has
demonstrated
that
SE
produced
less
pain
reduction
compared
with
a
specific
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapy
-LSB-42-RSB-
.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
no
published
systematic
review
or
guideline
on
the
efficacy
of
SE
for
subjects
with
chronic
LBP
has
been
conducted
.
Therefore,
the
effectiveness
of
SE
compared
with
other
treatments
remains
unclear
.
Clinicians
may
also
be
undecided
whether
or
not
SE
should
be
prescribed
in
patients
with
chronic
LBP
.
It
is
necessary
to
conduct
a
systematic
evaluation
of
RCTs
focusing
on
SE
for
patients
with
chronic
LBP
in
this
case
.
We
performed
a
systematic
review
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
SE
in
participants
with
chronic
LBP
.
The
results
of
this
study
provided
information
to
help
clinicians
come
up
with
evidence-based
decisions
on
the
use
of
SE
for
patients
with
chronic
LBP
.

We
used
LBP,
SE,
and
RCTs
as
search
terms
-LRB-full

.
To
increase
the
chance
of
finding
all
relevant
publications
describing
the
effects
of
SE
on
LBP,
we
did
not
set
limitations
on
language,
year,
or

during
the
initial
search
.
To
identify
gray
literature,
we
contacted
experts
and
inquired
regarding
materials
not
listed
in
these
databases
.
The
International
Controlled
Trials
Registry
Platform
was
also
searched,
in
which
SE
and
LBP
were
used
as
key
words,
to
obtain
relevant
registered
trials,
which
may
contain
additional
data,
but
did
not
have
any
published
papers
.
The
reference
lists
of
identified
articles
were
screened
manually
for
additional
studies
.
Inclusion
Criteria
Types
of
studies
Only
RCTs
investigating
the
use
of
SE
as
treatment
for
chronic
LBP
were
included
.
No
language
or
publication
date
restrictions
were
applied
.
Types
of
participants
The
study
samples
included
patients
with
chronic
LBP
affected
for
longer
than
three
months
.
Unless
an
adequate
washout
period
was
described,
patients
who
were
exposed
to
similar
treatments
prior
to
the
study
were
not
included
.
Types
of
interventions
We
included
articles
in
which
SE
was
compared
with
no
or
placebo
treatment,
as
well
as
any
other
treatment
for
chronic
LBP
.
In
the
SE
training
program,
the
neuromuscular
activation
was
induced
to
regain
normal
functional
movement
patterns
in
patients
with
musculoskeletal
disorders
-LSB-33-RSB-
.
SE
was
performed
using
specially
designed
devices,
such
as
Record
Trainer
or
TerapiMaster
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-43-RSB-
.
Trials
in
which
a
treatment
was
applied
with
concomitant
therapy
were
accepted
as
long
as
similar
treatments
were
applied
in
the
control
conditions
.
Types
of
outcome
measures
The
findings
were
analyzed
in
three
primary
outcome
categories:
-LRB-1-RRB-
self-reported
pain;
-LRB-2-RRB-
back
pain
specific
functional
status;
and
-LRB-3-RRB-
return
to
work
-LRB-expressed
as
the
number
of
days
of
sick
leave
or
the
proportion
of
patients
returned
to
work-RRB-
.
Secondary
outcomes
of
this
review
include
global
improvement,
health-related
quality
of
life,
satisfaction
with
treatment,
and
adverse
events
.
We
categorized
outcomes
as
long
term
-LRB-12
months-RRB-,
intermediate
-LRB-closer
to
6
months-RRB-,
or
short
term
-LRB-post-treatment
assessment
no
longer
than
12
weeks-RRB-
.
Selection
of
Studies
Two
reviewers
-LRB-Yue
YS,
Zhu
Y-RRB-
independently
screened
for
potentially
relevant
titles
and
abstracts
based
on
the
pre-specified
criteria;
full-text
articles
were
retrieved
whenever
necessary
.
Any
disagreements
were
resolved
by
discussion
or
consultation
with
a
third
independent
reviewer
-LRB-Wang
XQ-RRB-
if
necessary
.
Data
Extraction
Two
independent
reviewers
-LRB-Yue
YS,
Zhu
Y-RRB-
abstracted
and
cross-checked
the
data
obtained
from
the
included
trials
.
These
data
were
then
compiled
in
a
pre-designed
data
extraction
form
.
The
data
extraction
form
included
study
design
-LRB-treatment
allocation,
concealed
allocation,
blinding,
intention-to-treat
analysis,
etc.-RRB-,
participant
characteristics
-LRB-mean
age,
group
distribution,
etc.-RRB-,
description
of
control
and
treatment
interventions
-LRB-SE
style
and
practices,
type
of
control
intervention,
frequency,
total
duration,
etc.-RRB-,
outcome
measures
used,
and
follow-up
period
.
Any
disagreements
were
resolved
by
discussion
to
obtain
a
consensus
.
The
authors
were
also
contacted
to
provide
further
information
when
deemed
necessary
.
Quality
Assessment
The
two
independent
reviewers
-LRB-Yue
YS,
Zhu
Y-RRB-
used
the
Cochrane
Collaborations
risk
of
bias
tool
to
evaluate
the
methodological
quality
of
all
included
studies
.
The
following
domains
were
evaluated:
random
sequence
generation,
allocation
concealment,
blinding
of
participants
and
personnel,
blinding
of
outcome
assessments,
incomplete
outcome
data,
selective
reporting,
and
other
bias
-LSB-44-RSB-
.
For
each
domain,
each
studys
description
of
methods
was
examined
and
the
judgment
regarding
potential
bias
was
made,
according
to
three
categories:
low
risk,
high
risk
and
unclear
risk
-LSB-45-RSB-
.
The
overall
risk
of
bias
of
individual
study
was
rated
as
low
-LRB-low
risk
of
bias
for
all
domains-RRB-,
high
-LRB-high
risk
of
bias
for
one
or
more
domains-RRB-
or
unclear
-LRB-unclear
risk
of
bias
for
one
or
more
domains-RRB-
-LSB-46-RSB-
.
A
third
independent
reviewer
-LRB-Wang
XQ-RRB-
was
consulted
to
resolve
disagreements
.
Statistical
Analysis
Data
were
analyzed
with
the
Review
Manager
statistical
software
-LRB-RevMan
version
5.2-RRB-
by
using
a
random-effects
model
.
Random
effects
meta-analysis
was
performed
to
combine
the
results
because
we
predicted
that
study
characteristics
and
other
factors
were
different,
suggesting
that
the
effects
may
differ
across
studies
.
Chi-square
test
was
performed
to
detect
statistically
significant
heterogeneity
-LSB-47-RSB-
.
We
then
estimated
the
amount
of
heterogeneity
among
studies
by
using
the
I2
statistic:
<25%,
low;
<50%,
moderate
heterogeneity;
and
>50%,
substantial
heterogeneity
-LSB-48-RSB-
.
Heterogeneity
was
further
investigated
by
checking
data
extracted
from
outlier
studies
and
exploring
the
effects
of
study
exclusion
in
sensitivity
analyses
.
No
funnel
plots
or
assessments
for
publication
bias
were
performed
because
of
the
small
number
of
trials
-LRB-maximum
five
trials-RRB-
that
were
pooled
in
the
comparisons
included
in
this
literature
.
The
control
conditions
were
divided
into
five
groups:
other
forms
of
exercise;
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapy;
thermomagnetic
therapy;
physical
agents
in
combination
with
drug
therapy;
and
no
treatment
.
We
then
performed
separate
meta-analyses
for
short-term,
intermediate,
and
long-term
follow-up
time
points
.
One
study
included
two
different
control
groups,
which
were
individually
considered
during
analysis
-LSB-49-RSB-
.
Analyses
were
only
possible
for
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
because
of
absence
of
data
for
return
to
work,
global
improvement,
health-related
quality
of
life,
satisfaction
with
treatment,
and
adverse
events
.
In
the
included
studies,
several
outcome
measures
were
used
to
assess
the
constructs
of
self-reported
pain,
including
a
10
mm
or
100
mm
visual
analogue
scale
-LRB-VAS-RRB-
-LSB-43-RSB-
or
0-point
to
10-point
numerical
pain
rating
scale
-LRB-NPRS-RRB-
-LSB-34-RSB-,
and
the
back
pain
specific
functional
status,
such
as
100-point
Oswestry
disability
index
-LRB-ODI-RRB-
-LSB-40-RSB-
or
modified
Oswestry
disability
index
-LRB-M-ODI-RRB-
-LSB-34-RSB-
.
Moderate
to
high
correlations
between
the
different
measures
of
the
two
constructs
were
obtained
-LSB-50-RSB-
.
In
this
literature,
the
individual
trial
outcomes
for
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
were
linearly
rescaled
to
a
0
to
100
scoring
system,
in
which
lower
scores
indicated
better
outcomes,
to
facilitate
the
comparison
and
interpretability
of
the
syntheses
-LSB-49-RSB-,
-LSB-51-RSB-,
-LSB-52-RSB-
.
For
example,
we
rescaled
a
NPRS
pain
score
of
2.31.1
points
-LRB-mean
SD-RRB-
out
of
10
points
to
2311
points
out
of
100
points,
where
positive
mean
effect
sizes
indicated
an
improvement
that
is
decreased
pain
.
All
of
the
variables
included
in
the
analysis
were
continuous;
as
such,
the
inverse
variance
method
was
used
to
calculate
the
weighted
mean
differences
-LRB-WMDs-RRB-
and
the
corresponding
95%
confidence
intervals
-LRB-95%
CIs-RRB-
for
each
study
based
on
the
post-intervention
means
of
each
group
and
the
pooled
standard
deviation
.
Two-sided
statistical
tests
were
performed
.
P<0.05
or
95%
confidence
interval
that
excluded
a
null
result
was
considered
statistically
significant
-LSB-53-RSB-
.
On
the
basis
of
current
research
on
minimal
clinically
significant
differences,
a
20-point
-LRB-of
100
points-RRB-
improvement
in
pain
-LSB-54-RSB-
and
a
10-point
-LRB-of
100
points-RRB-
improvement
in
functional
outcomes
-LSB-55-RSB-
were
considered
as
clinically
meaningful
.

Among
these
data,
5,197

.
Among
these
remaining

Conflict
of
interest
One
study
-LSB-34-RSB-
was
financed
by
the
Norwegian
Fund
for
Post-Graduate

in
Physiotherapy,
and
sponsorship
of
other

-LSB-38-RSB--LSB-40-RSB-
adequately

.
The
remaining
5
trials
-LSB-35-RSB--LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
were
randomized,
but
no
details
were
provided
.
One
trial
-LSB-34-RSB-
had
adequate
allocation
concealment,
but
we
could
not
determine
the
allocation
concealment
in
the
remaining
8
trials
-LSB-35-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
None
of
the
9
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
met
the
blinding
of
participants,
personnel
and
outcome
assessors
criterion
.
Given
the
direct
participant-personnel
involvement
due
to
the
nature
of
therapeutic
trials,
and
self-reported
outcome
measures
such
as
VAS
and
NPRS,
it
was
not
feasible
to
blind
participants,
personnel
and
outcome
assessors
.
While
the
blinding
in
9
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
was
not
feasible,
it
was
still
an
inherent
source
of
bias
that
must
be
highlighted
for
every
trial
.
The
risk
of
incomplete
outcome
data
was
low
for
only
6
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
.
Selective
outcome
reporting
was
at
a
low
risk
of
bias
in
all
9
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
Sources
of
other
bias
were
unclear
in
9
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
Overall,
nine
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
were
adjudicated
to
be
of
high
risk
of
bias
.

The
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
comparing
SE
with
other
forms
of
exercise
failed
to
reveal
significant
differences
in
self-reported
pain
at
short-term
-LSB-7.30
point
-LRB-CI=14.86
to
0.25-RRB--RSB-,
intermediate
-LSB-3.81
point
-LRB-CI=16.98
to
9.36-RRB--RSB-,
and
long-term
-LSB-3.70
point
-LRB-CI=3.16
to
10.55-RRB--RSB-
follow-up
periods
.
However,
significant
heterogeneities
for
short-term
and
intermediate
self-reported
pain
were
derived
when
SE
was
compared
with
other
forms
of
exercise
.
The
heterogeneity
for
short-term
self-reported
pain
was
substantially
high
-LRB-I2=88%-RRB-
.
A
visual
inspection
of
the
forest
plot
indicated
that
two
studies
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
in
which
the
control
treatment
was
mainly
conducted
by
patients
at
home,
were
the
most
likely
source
of
heterogeneity
.
A
meta-analysis
excluding
these
two
studies
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-
indicated
a
substantially
reduced
heterogeneity
-LRB-I2=39%-RRB-
and
revealed
a
statistically
non-significant
effect
size
-LSB-3.01
point
-LRB-CI=7.22
to
1.21-RRB--RSB-
.
For
intermediate
self-reported
pain,
high
I2
value
-LRB-I2=62%-RRB-
derived
in
the
random
effects
analysis
also
suggested
a
substantial
heterogeneity
between
the
included
studies
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
.
This
result
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
included
trials
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
differed
in
patient
populations
and
treatment
durations
.
The
baseline
scores
of
pain
obtained
by
Qin
et
al
-LSB-36-RSB-
were
>1.5
points
higher
than
those
in
Wang
et
al
-LSB-41-RSB-;
by
comparison,
the
treatment
duration
presented
by
Qin
et
al
-LSB-36-RSB-
was
two
weeks
shorter
than
that
reported
by
Wang
et
al
-LSB-41-RSB-
.
However,
neither
of
the
studies
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
yielded
statistically
significant
effects
of
SE
on
the
decrease
in
intermediate
self-reported
pain
compared
with
other
forms
of
exercise
.
This
result
is
consistent
with
that
of
the
pooled
analysis
.
No
significant
differences
were
observed
in
short-term
back
pain
specific
functional
status
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
-LSB-6.57
point
-LRB-CI=14.09
to
0.96-RRB--RSB-
.
We
also
observed
a
statistically,
but
probably
not
clinically
meaningful
difference
in
the
intermediate
back
pain
specific
functional
status
-LSB-8.81
point
-LRB-CI=13.82
to
3.80-RRB--RSB-
in
favor
of
SE
compared
with
other
forms
of
exercise
.
The
statistical
heterogeneity
for
short-term
back
pain
specific
functional
status
was
substantially
high
-LRB-I2=91%-RRB-
.
This
result
may
be
attributed
to
the
inclusion
of
one
trial
-LSB-34-RSB-,
in
which
SE
was
performed
less
frequently
than
in
remaining
trials
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
.
Eliminating
this
study
-LSB-34-RSB-
from
the
analysis,
we
no
longer
observed
heterogeneity
-LRB-I2
=0%-RRB-
.
Nevertheless,
the
result
was
statistically
significant,
which
differed
from
the
conclusion
of
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
short-term
back
pain
specific
functional
status
.
A
subgroup
analysis
based
on
the
frequency
of
SE
was
then
performed,
and
the
result
showed
that
smaller
effect
sizes
were
achieved
in
trials,
in
which
SE
was
performed
less
frequently
.
SE
compared
with
traditional
chinese
medical
therapies
Among
the
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-,
two
-LRB-89
patients-RRB-
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
demonstrated
SE
and
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
with
randomly
assigning
patients
-LRB-35
and
34
patients,
respectively-RRB-;
the
results
regarding
self-reported
pain
were
determined
using
VAS
.
The
results
of
our
meta-analysis
are
shown
in
Figure
4.10.1371/journal.pone.0099307
.
g004Figure

Self-reported
pain

exercise
versus

.
The
meta-analysis
of
two
trials
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
showed
that
SE
and
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
were
different
in
terms
of
the
short-term
self-reported
pain
-LSB-5.29
point
-LRB-CI=20.27
to
9.70-RRB--RSB-,
but
this
result
was
not
significant
.
The
pooled
studies
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
demonstrated
substantially
high
levels
of
heterogeneity
-LRB-I2=56%-RRB-,
probably
because
of
the
differences
between
the
two
included
trials
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
in
terms
of
participant
populations
and
treatment
durations
.
The
baseline
scores
of
pain
observed
by
Liu
et
al
-LSB-42-RSB-
were
higher
than
those
of
Gao
et
al
-LSB-37-RSB-
by
more
than
two
points
.
By
comparison,
the
treatment
duration
obtained
by
Liu
et
al
-LSB-42-RSB-
was
four
weeks
shorter
than
that
observed
by
Gao
et
al
-LSB-37-RSB-
.
Neither
of
the
studies
-LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
indicated
the
positive
effects
of
SE
on
the
decrease
in
short-term
self-reported
pain
compared
with
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
.
This
result
is
similar
to
that
obtained
in
pooled
analysis
.
SE
compared
with
thermomagnetic
therapy
Two
studies
-LRB-160
patients-RRB-
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
assessed
SE
performed
by
70
patients
and
thermomagnetic
therapy
conducted
by
70
patients;
data
on
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
were
presented
.
For
the
two
studies
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-,
self-reported
pain
was
determined
using
VAS
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-,
and
both
studies
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
assessed
back
pain
specific
functional
status
by
using
ODI
.
The
weighted
mean
difference
-LRB-95%
CI-RRB-
results
of
the
included
trials
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
are

We
observed
significant
differences
between
SE
and
thermomagnetic
therapy
for
self-reported
pain
at
either
short-term
-LSB-13.90
point
-LRB-CI=22.19
to
5.62-RRB--RSB-
or
long-term
-LSB-26.20
point
-LRB-CI=31.32
to
21.08-RRB--RSB-
follow-up
periods
.
The
heterogeneity
of
short-term
self-reported
pain
was
substantially
high
-LRB-I2=62%-RRB-
.
This
result
may
be
due
to
differences
in
the
frequency
of
SE
between
the
two
included
trials
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
.
SE
was
performed
less
frequently
as
revealed
by
Jin
et
al
-LSB-39-RSB-
than
by
Hu
et
al
-LSB-40-RSB-
.
The
two
studies
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
comparing
SE
with
thermomagnetic
therapy
both
reported
the
positive
effects
of
SE
on
the
reduction
of
short-term
self-reported
pain
.
This
result
is
consistent
with
that
of
the
pooled
analysis
.
We
recorded
both
statistically
and
clinically
significant
differences
between
SE
and
thermomagnetic
therapy
for
back
pain
specific
functional
status
at
either
short-term
-LSB-10.54
point
-LRB-CI=14.32

or
long-term
-LSB-25.75
point
-LRB-CI=30.79
to
20.71-RRB--RSB-
follow-up
periods
.
SE
compared
with
the
combination
of
physical
agents
and
drug
therapy
Self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
were
evaluated
in
a
randomized
controlled
trial
-LSB-38-RSB-,
in
which
82
patients
receiving
SE
and
another
82
patients
receiving
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy
were
included
.
In
this
trial
-LSB-38-RSB-,
self-reported
pain
was
determined
using
NPRS,
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
was
determined
using
M-ODI
.
This
trial
-LSB-38-RSB-
showed
significant
differences
between
SE
and
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy
for
either
self-reported
pain
-LSB-15.00
point
-LRB-CI=19.64

and
another
20
participants

reported
data
for
self-reported

which
was
measured
by
VAS
.
This
trial
-LSB-42-RSB-
indicated
no
difference
between
SE
in
addition
to
acupuncture
therapy
and
the
acupuncture
therapy
alone
for
self-reported

at

Discussion
Systematic
reviews
-LSB-62-RSB-,
-LSB-63-RSB-
have
been
conducted
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
exercise
therapy
in
participants
with
chronic
LBP
.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
this
study
is
the
first
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
that
evaluated
the
effects
of
SE
on
chronic
LBP
management
.
We
derived
the
following
points
to
provide
useful
information
for
caregivers
as
a
guide
for
patient
management,
to
assist
guideline
developers
in
creating
guidelines
for
the
use
of
SE
in
the
chronic
LBP
treatment,
and
to
allow
policy
makers
in
tailoring
intervention
options
towards
the
desired
outcome,
available
resources,
and
local
healthcare
context
.
The
meta-analysis
showed
no
statistically
significant
or
clinically
relevant
differences
in
self-reported
pain
at
short-term,
intermediate,
and
long-term
follow-up
periods
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
.
SE
is
no
more
efficacious
than
other
forms
of
exercise
in
improving
back
pain
specific
functional
status
at
short-term
follow-up
period
among
patients
with
chronic
LBP
.
However,
there
is
a
small,
clinically
irrelevant
benefit
of
SE
over
other
forms
of
exercise
on
intermediate
back
pain
specific
functional
status,
based
on
an
evaluation
of
less
than
60
patients
in
2
trials,
which
both
did
not
perform
allocation
concealment
or
blinded
outcome
assessment,
and
intention-to-treat
analysis
was
only
performed
in
one
of
which
.
SE
is
as
effective
as
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
in
decreasing
short-term
self-reported
pain,
which
is
consistent
with
the
findings
of
some
published
systematic
reviews
-LSB-62-RSB-,
-LSB-63-RSB-
which
suggest
that
exercise
therapy
and
massage
are
equally
effective
for
chronic
LBP
.
The
results
indicated
that
SE
was
more
effective
than
thermomagnetic
therapy
for
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
in
short-
or
long-term
follow-up
periods,
but
the
substantial
heterogeneity
for
short-term
self-reported
pain
comparing
SE
with
thermomagnetic
therapy
was
recorded
.
In
one
trial,
significant
differences
between
SE
and
physical
agents
combined
with
drug
therapy
were
derived
for
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
in
the
short-tern,
which
was
consistent
with
the
findings
of
some
published
trials
-LSB-64-RSB-,
-LSB-65-RSB-,
-LSB-66-RSB-,
-LSB-67-RSB-
where
exercise
therapy
is
more
effective
than
physical
agents
or
drug
therapy
in
pain
relief
and
functional
improvement,
and
systematic
reviews
-LSB-62-RSB-,
-LSB-63-RSB-
where
exercise
therapy
is
more
effective
than
usual
care
by
a
general
practitioner
for
chronic
LBP
.
Concerning
short-term
self-reported
pain,
no
significant
differences
between
SE
combined
with
acupuncture
therapy
and
acupuncture
therapy
alone
were
found
in
one
trial
.
Strengths
Our
study
presented
several
strengths
.
We
collected
data
by
using
a
broad
search
strategy
with
the
following
procedures:
searching
multiple
citation
databases;
soliciting
experts
for
published
or
unpublished
studies;
searching
trial
registries;
and
screening
the
references
of
identified
trials
.
Also,
no
language
restriction
was
applied
.
This
strategy
suggested
that
our
synthesis
represented
the
current
state
of
related
studies
.
We
also
performed
our
review
according
to
previously
published
protocol
and
methodological
guidelines
.
The
consistency
of
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status,
which
were
primary
outcomes
of
our
review,
was
satisfactory
.
All
of
the
studies
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
in
this
literature
included
a
measure
of
self-reported
pain
and
two-thirds
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB--LSB-41-RSB-
of
the
studies
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
included
a
measure
of
back
pain
specific
functional
status
.
Limitations
First,
our
systematic
review
is
limited
because
all
of
the
studies
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
included
in
our
literature
contain
methodological
drawbacks,
which
may
lead
to
an
overestimated
effect
.
Risk
of
bias
was
rated
as
high
in
all
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
The
most
frequent
methodological
shortcoming
in
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
was
lack
of
blinding
of
patients,
caregivers
and
assessors,
due
to
the
nature
of
the
therapeutic
interventions
indicating
that
the
blinding
of
patients
and
caregivers
was
almost
impossible
and
patient-reported
outcomes
such
as
self-reported
pain
.
Second,
the
implementation
of
outcome
measures
is
notably
limited
.
Although
the
data
for
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
were
available
for
the
majority
of
studies
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-,
the
evaluations
of
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
were
not
standardized,
indicating
that
different
trials
would
use
different
pain
surveys
or
back
pain
functional
status
measures
as
outcome
measures,
which
could
lead
to
the
heterogeneity
derived
among
the
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
Few
researchers
reported
return
to
work,
global
improvement,
health-related
quality
of
life,
satisfaction
with
treatment
or
adverse
events;
hence,
no
interpretations
on
the
differences
in
these
outcomes
based
on
the
treatment
type
used
were
presented
.
Data
for
any
outcome
at
intermediate
or
long-term
follow-up
period
were
sparse,
suggesting
that
the
efficacy
of
SE
at
intermediate
and
long-term
follow-up
periods
is
not
well
known
.
Only
two
of
the
included
studies
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
assessed
the
intermediate
efficacy,
and
long-term
data
were
only
available
for
one
study
-LSB-34-RSB-
included
in
our
review
.
Third,
all
included
studies
-LSB-35-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-,
except
one
study
-LSB-34-RSB-
which
was
sponsored
by
the
Norwegian
Fund
for
Post-Graduate
Training
in
Physiotherapy,
did
not
report
sponsoring
agent
.
This
serves
to
limit
the
study
as
it
could
lead
to
an
overestimation
of
the
efficacy
of
SE
in
participants
with
chronic
LBP
.
For
example,
the
inclusion
of
only
trials
-LSB-35-RSB-,
-LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-,
the
sponsorship
of
which
was
not
mentioned,
substantially
changed
the
conclusion
of
no
difference
in
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
at
short-term
follow-up
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
.
Fourth,
we
were
unable
to
retrieve
four
full-text
studies
-LSB-56-RSB-,
-LSB-59-RSB--LSB-61-RSB-
that
may
be
suitable
for
the
analysis;
these
studies
were
then
considered
to
limit
the
review
because
whether
or
not
the
results
of
these
trials
-LSB-56-RSB-,
-LSB-59-RSB--LSB-61-RSB-
alter
the
conclusions
derived
in
this
review
remains
unknown
.
Fifth,
the
sample
sizes
of
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
included
in
our
systematic
review
were
relatively
small,
such
that
only
one
third
-LSB-34-RSB-,
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-
of
the
studies
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
in
our
review
enrolled
100
or
more
patients
.
Several
trials
-LSB-35-RSB--LSB-37-RSB-,
-LSB-39-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
with
small
sample
sizes
-LRB-<100
participants-RRB-
are
likely
to
be
underpowered
to
detect
relatively
small
disparities
between
the
effects
of
SE
and
that
of
the
control
conditions;
these
studies
may
overestimate
the
efficacy
of
SE
in
participants
with
chronic
LBP
.
However,
the
inclusion
of
only
small
trials
-LRB-<100
participants-RRB-
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-36-RSB-,
-LSB-41-RSB-
influenced
neither
the
direction
nor
the
significance
of
the
result
of
our
study
that
no
statistically
or
clinically
significant
differences
in
self-reported
pain
and
back
pain
specific
functional
status
at
short-term
follow-up
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
were
derived
.
Lastly,
the
limited
number
of
RCTs
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
published
in
this
study
area
might
raise
the
possibility
of
publication
bias
.
Nine
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
conducted
is
significantly
low
in
therapeutic
research,
such
that
the
outcome
comparisons
included
only
a
few
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-,
and
the
results
of
certain
comparisons
can
easily
be
dominated
by
a
single
trial
-LSB-38-RSB-,
-LSB-40-RSB-,
-LSB-42-RSB-
.
No
unpublished
studies
were
obtained
despite
the
substantial
search
.
Implications
for
Research
Well-designed
and
sufficiently
powered
studies
with
larger
sample
sizes
should
be
conducted
to
clarify
whether
or
not
SE
improves
chronic
LBP
because
of
limitations
in
included
trials
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-
.
And
we
identified
several
implications
for
further
research
.
First,
future
trials
should
adequately
use
random
sequence
generation
and
random
concealment,
and
completely
report
outcome
data
.
Second,
future
studies
should
be
conducted
in
populations
that
best
represent
patients
with
chronic
LBP;
hence,
patient
selection
should
be
carefully
considered
.
Third,
SE
should
be
well
designed,
and
interventions
should
be
thoroughly
described
.
The
treatment
affected
short-term
back
pain
specific
functional
status
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
at
a
less
extent
in
trials
in
which
SE
was
performed
less
frequently
-LSB-34-RSB-
.
Hence,
studies
should
evaluate
the
frequency
at
which
SE
is
more
effective
than
others
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
LBP
.
Fourth,
the
outcome
measures
for
future
studies
should
include
pain
intensity,
functional
status,
and
general
health
.
This
recommendation
is
based
on
the
standard
use
of
outcome
measures
in
back
pain
research
in
1998,
including
a
minimum
of
pain
intensity,
functional
status,
and
general
health
measures
-LSB-68-RSB-
.
We
believe
that
the
intermediate
or
long-term
efficacy
associated
with
SE
should
be
accurately
assessed,
particularly
with
standardized
methods
to
report
outcomes
based
on
published
recommendations
.
Fifth,
further
studies
should
also
be
conducted
regarding
the
relative
cost
effectiveness
of
SE
and
the
potential
active
mechanisms
of
SE
for
chronic
LBP
.
Sixth,
researchers
should
register
RCTs
and
adhere
to
the
CONSORT
guidelines
to
improve
the
quality
of
studies
.
Journals
on
the
field
of
back
pain
should
adopt
reporting
guidelines
and
apply
these
guidelines
in
their
review
process
to
improve
the
quality
of
future
reports
in
this
field
-LSB-51-RSB-,
-LSB-69-RSB-
.
Conclusions
SE
is
no
more
efficacious
in
reducing
self-reported
pain
or
improving
back
pain
specific
functional
status
compared
with
other
forms
of
exercise
or
traditional
Chinese
medical
therapies
with
the
exception
of
a
statistically
significant,
but
clinically
probably
irrelevant
improvement
in
intermediate
back
pain
specific
functional
status
between
SE
and
other
forms
of
exercise
.
In
comparison
to
thermomagnetic
therapy
or
the
combination
of
physical
agents
and
drug
therapy,
SE
more
effectively
decreased
self-reported
pain
or
improved
back
pain
specific
functional
status
.
SE
in
addition
to
acupuncture
therapy
is
as
effective
as
acupuncture
therapy
alone
for
reduction
of
self-reported
pain
and
improvement
of
back
pain
specific
functional
status
.
However,
the
interpretation
of
our
findings
is
required
to
be
made
with
caution
due
to
limitations
in
included
trials
such
as
methodological
drawbacks
and
small
sample
sizes
.
