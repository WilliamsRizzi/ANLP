The	O
most	O
frequent	O
methodological	O
shortcoming	O
in	O
included	O

-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-	O
was	O
lack	O
of	O
blinding	O
of	O
patients,	O
caregivers	O
and	O

due	O
to	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
therapeutic	O
interventions	O
indicating	O
that	O
the	O
blinding	O
of	O
patients	O
and	O

was	O
almost	O
impossible	O
and	O
patient-reported	O
outcomes	O

And	O
we	O
identified	O
several	O
implications	O
for	O
further	O

First,	O

Second,	O

should	O
be	O
conducted	O
in	O
populations	O
that	O
best	O
represent	O
patients	O
with	O
chronic	O
LBP;	O
hence,	O
patient	O
selection	O
should	O
be	O
carefully	O
considered	O
.	O
Third,	O
SE	O
should	O
be	O
well	O

in	O

in	O
which	O
SE	O
was	O

Hence,	O

than	O

Fourth,	O
the	O
outcome	O

should	O
include	O

We	O

that	O
