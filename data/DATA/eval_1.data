Background
This
study
investigated
the
nature
of
newspaper
reporting
about
online
health
information
in
the
UK
and
US
.
Internet
users
frequently
search
for
health
information
online,
although
the
accuracy
of
the
information
retrieved
varies
greatly
and
can
be
misleading
.
Newspapers
have
the
potential
to
influence
public
health
behaviours,
but
information
has
been
lacking
in
relation
to
how
newspapers
portray
online
health
information
to
their
readers
.
Methods
The
newspaper
database
NexisUK
was
searched
for
articles
published
from
2003
2012
relating
to
online
health
information
.
Systematic
content
analysis
of
articles
published
in
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
was
performed
.
A
second
researcher
coded
a
10%
sample
to
establish
inter-rater
reliability
of
coding
.
Results
In
total,
161
newspaper
articles
were
included
in
the
analysis
.
Publication
was
most
frequent
in
2003,
2008
and
2009,
which
coincided
with
global
threats
to
public
health
.
UK
broadsheet
newspapers
were
significantly
more
likely
to
cover
online
health
information
than
UK
tabloid
newspapers
-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
and
only
one
article
was
identified
in
US
tabloid
newspapers
.
Articles
most
frequently
appeared
in
health
sections
.
Among
the
79
articles
that
linked
online
health
information
to
specific
diseases
or
health
topics,
diabetes
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease,
cancer
the
commonest
group
of
diseases
and
sexual
health
the
most
frequent
health
topic
.
Articles
portrayed
benefits
of
obtaining
online
health
information
more
frequently
than
risks
.
Quotations
from
health
professionals
portrayed
mixed
opinions
regarding
public
access
to
online
health
information
.
108
-LRB-67.1%-RRB-
articles
directed
readers
to
specific
health-related
web
sites
.
135
-LRB-83.9%-RRB-
articles
were
rated
as
having
balanced
judgement
and
76
-LRB-47.2%-RRB-
were
judged
as
having
excellent
quality
reporting
.
No
difference
was
found
in
the
quality
of
reporting
between
UK
and
US
articles
.
Conclusions
Newspaper
coverage
of
online
health
information
was
low
during
the
10-year
period
2003
to
2012
.
Journalists
tended
to
emphasise
the
benefits
and
understate
the
risks
of
online
health
information
and
the
quality
of
reporting
varied
considerably
.
Newspapers
directed
readers
to
sources
of
online
health
information
during
global
epidemics
although,
as
most
articles
appeared
in
the
health
sections
of
broadsheet
newspapers,
coverage
was
limited
to
a
relatively
small
readership
.
Electronic
supplementary
material
The
online
version
of
this
article
-LRB-doi:10.1186/1471-2458-14-1316-RRB-
contains
supplementary
material,
which
is
available
to
authorized
users
.
Background
Approximately
7
in
10
adult
Internet
users
in
the
UK
and
US
search
online
for
health
information
annually
-LSB-1,
2-RSB-
.
Commonly
reported
motivators
for
seeking
online
health
information
include
chronic
illness
-LSB-3,
4-RSB-,
self-diagnosis
-LSB-2-RSB-,
receipt
of
a
new
diagnosis
-LSB-5-RSB-,
dissatisfaction
with
health
care
providers
-LSB-6-RSB-
and
searching
for
lifestyle
advice
-LSB-7-RSB-
.
While
the
Internet
provides
convenient
public
access
to
health
information,
evidence
suggests
that
searching
for
health
information
is
challenging
for
the
average
Internet
user,
not
only
due
to
the
volume
and
variable
quality
of
information
that
may
be
retrieved,
but
also
due
to
differences
in
searching
ability
and
comprehension
among
consumers
-LSB-8,
9-RSB-
.
Furthermore,
many
studies
have
reported
that
the
accuracy
of
health
information
retrieved
in
Internet
searches
varies
greatly
and
can
be
misleading
.
For
example,
Agricola
et
al
reported
recently
that
preconception
advice
retrieved
via
the
Google
search
engine
was
generally
inconsistent
and
frequently
incomplete
-LSB-10-RSB-
and
Singh
et
al
found
that
approximately
one
third
of
YouTube
videos
relating
to
rheumatoid
arthritis
contained
misleading
information
and
over
90%
promoted
unscientific
therapies
-LSB-11-RSB-
.
Using
inaccurate
or
misleading
health
information
for
decision
making
purposes,
without
expert
advice,
could
potentially
have
a
serious
negative
impact
on
the
individual
user
and
on
public
health
in
general
-LSB-12-RSB-
.
Thus,
it
is
paramount
that
consumers
are
informed
of
the
risks
associated
with
searching
for
health
information
online
and
information
seekers
should
be
directed
to
accurate
and
credible
web
sites
.
Who
should
perform
these
roles?
.
Media
coverage
is
an
important
source
of
public
knowledge
on
health-related
issues
and
evidence
suggests
that
the
mass
media
has
the
potential
to
influence
health
behaviours
-LSB-13-RSB-
.
Newspapers
are
an
important
element
of
the
mass
media
and
approximately
one
third
of
adults
in
Great
Britain
read
at
least
one
national
daily
newspaper
each
day
-LSB-14-RSB-
.
However,
evidence
suggests
that
the
quality
of
health
reporting
in
newspapers
tends
to
be
poor
.
An
evaluation
of
500
health
news
stories
published
in
US
newspapers
between
2006
and
2008
reported
that
between
62%
and
77%
of
articles
failed
to
adequately
address
costs,
harms,
benefits,
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
the
existence
of
other
options
when
covering
health
care
products
and
procedures
-LSB-15-RSB-
.
Furthermore,
newspapers
tend
to
overemphasise
benefits
and
under-represent
risks
when
reporting
on
health
interventions
-LSB-16,
17-RSB-
.
Nothing
is
known
about
how
the
newspaper
media
portray
the
Internet
as
a
source
of
health
information
.
Journalists
often
use
health
web
sites
as
information
sources
for
their
articles
but
rarely
comment
on
their
quality
or
credibility
-LSB-18-RSB-
.
Ideally,
newspaper
articles
should
be
accurate
and
balanced
so
that
readers
can
make
informed
decisions
regarding
the
Internet
as
a
source
of
health
information
.
If
newspaper
reporting
is
inaccurate,
imbalanced,
or
incomplete,
readers
may
develop
unrealistic
perceptions
of
the
value
of
online
health
information,
therefore,
the
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
how
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portray
health
information
on
the
Internet,
including
social
media,
websites
and
blogs,
to
the
public
in
terms
of
the
frequency,
nature
and
quality
of
reporting
.
Methods
Study
design
We
employed
systematic
content
analysis
to
examine
how
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portrayed
online
health
information
in
the
10-year
period
between
1st
January
2003
and
the
31st
December
2012
.
Selection
of
newspaper
articles
The
NexisUK
database
is
a
full
text
archive
of
newspapers
published
globally
and
has
been
used
widely
in
previous
studies
of
media
coverage
of
health-related
issues
-LSB-1921-RSB-
.
We
searched
a
purposive
sample
of
UK

and
ten
daily

together
with
their
Sunday

at
the
time
of
commencement
of

-LSB-23-RSB-,
which
comprised
USA
Today,
Wall

Search
strategy
Following
empiric
testing
of
several
search
terms,
we
used
the
search
term
Internet
AND
health
information
to
search
the
NexisUK
database
for
all
articles
-LRB-including
news
articles,
editorials,
magazine
supplements,
letters,
etc.-RRB-
that
contained
any
reference
to
the
search
term
in
either
the
headline
or
text
during
the
period
from
1st
January
2003
to
31st
December
2012
.
The
primary
researcher
-LRB-BMcC-RRB-
retrieved
and
read
all
of
the
archived
newspaper
articles
.
Items
were
excluded
if
online
health
information
was
mentioned
only
briefly
-LRB-i.e
<10%
of
the
article
by
word
count-RRB-,
if
they
focussed
on
business
issues
-LRB-e.g
technology
company
share
prices-RRB-
or
if
online
health
information
was
mentioned
only
as
part
of
an
announcement,
e.g
announcement
of
an
adult
learning
class
.
We
included
only
the
article
with
the
highest
word
count
when
an
article
was
duplicated
in
both
a
daily
newspaper
and
its
Sunday
equivalent
.
We
searched
the
PubMed
database
using
the
same
search
terms
and
dates
to
compare
the
frequency
of
publication
of
newspaper
articles
with
publication
of
scientific
articles
related
to
this
topic
.
Article
coding
We
established
an
a
priori
coding
system
based
on
systems
used
in
previously
published
systematic
media
content
analyses
-LSB-1619-RSB-
.
This
consisted
of
a
codebook
containing
the
list
of
variables
to
be
researched,
along
with
standardised
responses
and
coding
instructions,
and
a
coding
form
-LRB-see
Additional
file
1-RRB-
.
This
approach
provided
a
consistent
coding
framework
and
limited
the
potential
for
subjective
judgement
by
coders
.
Two
coders
piloted
the
coding
framework
by
coding
a
random
sample
of
ten
articles
independently
.
Following
the
pilot,
minor
adjustments
were
made
to
the
coding
system
to
increase
its
specificity
.
The
final
coding
frame
comprised
four
main
sections:
firstly;
the
name
of
the
newspaper,
the
title
of
the
article,
its
year
of
publication
and
the
newspaper
section
in
which
the
article
of
interest
appeared
were
recorded
.
Secondly;
the
themes
covered,
the
perspective
from
which
the
article
was
written,
whether
the
focus
was
on
a
particular
health
sector
or
illness,
benefits/risks
or
barriers/facilitators
relating
to
the
use
of
online
health
information
in
routine
clinical
practice,
and
the
source
of
the
information
contained
in
the
article
were
noted
.
In
the
third
section,
coders
were
required
to
make
subjective
judgements
on
the
main
emphasis
of
the
article,
claim
and
quality
of
information
.
Finally,
if
a
scientific
journal
article
was
identified
as
the
source
of
information
for
the
newspaper
article,
all
reasonable
steps
were
taken
to
obtain
the
scientific
paper
and
its
title,
authors,
publication
date
and
disclosure
of
conflict
of
interest
were
recorded
.
The
primary
researcher
-LRB-BMcC-RRB-
used
the
final
coding
form
to
manually
code
the
selected
articles
.
A
second
coder
coded
a
10%
random
sub-sample
blindly
and
Cohens
kappa
-LRB--RRB-
scores
were
calculated
to
assess
inter-rater
agreement
for
questions
with
mutually
exclusive
answers
.
Questions
with
more
than
two
answers
were
dichotomised,
for
example,
Type
of
benefits
of
health-related
use
of
the
Internet
-LRB-nine
options
provided-RRB-,
was
collapsed
to
Was
a
benefit
stated?
.
-LRB-yes/no-RRB-
.
Where
diseases
were
specifically
mentioned,
they
were
classified
according
to
the
relevant
chapter
in
the
British
National
Formulary
-LRB-BNF-RRB-,
63rd
edition
-LRB-British
Medical
Association
and
the
Royal
Pharmaceutical
Society,
2012-RRB-
.
Statistical
analysis
Following
data
extraction,
codes
were
entered
into
SPSS
-LRB-version
19,
SPSS
Inc,
USA-RRB-
for
analysis
of
trends
and
comparison
of
variables
between
countries
.
Descriptive
statistics
were
used
to
summarise
the
data
.
The
Mann-Whitney
U
test
was
used
to
test
for
differences
between
means
of
continuous
variables
.
Differences
in
the
reporting
of
categorical
variables
in
UK
and
US
articles
were
assessed
using
the
Chi
square
test
-LRB-2-RRB-
or
the
Fishers
Exact
test,
as
appropriate
.
Statistical
significance
was
set
at
0.05
.
Results
Initially,
749
newspaper
articles
were
retrieved,
of
which
161
articles,
74
from
UK
papers
and
87
from
US
newspapers
remained
following
removal
of
duplicates
and
excluded
articles
-LRB-Figure1-RRB-
.
Inter-rater
kappa
values
ranged
from
0.5
to
1.0,
indicating
moderate
to
perfect
agreement
between
coders
-LSB-24-RSB-
.
The
mean
inter-rater
kappa
value
across
all
of
the
coded
variables
was
0.65;
this
is
similar
to
the
level
of
inter-rater
agreement
reported
in
previous
quantitative
content
analyses
involving
the
newspaper
media
-LSB-19,

Frequency
of
newspaper
reporting
The
number
of
articles
retrieved
from
UK
and
US
newspapers
ranged
from
7
in
2012
to
24
in
2009,
indicating
a
low
publication
frequency
relating
to
this
topic
.
The
highest
numbers
of
articles
were
published
in
2003
-LRB-21

2008
-LRB-21

and
2009
-LRB-24
articles-RRB-,
with
a
marked
decline
in
reporting
on
online
health
information
after
2009
-LRB-Figure2-RRB-
.
In
the
UK,
the
overall
trend
in
reporting
remained
relatively
constant
throughout
the
10-year
period,
while
an
overall
downward
trend
was
observed
in
the
US
.
During
the
same
period
there
was
an
increase
in
scientific
articles
on
this
topic
archived
in
PubMed
-LRB-Figure3-RRB-,
indicating
that,
during
this
time,
online
health
information
is
a
topic
that
has
been
researched
actively.Figure

Newspaper
type
and
positioning
of
articles
Strictly
speaking,
the
terms
broadsheet
and
tabloid
refer
to
newspaper
dimensions,
however,
broadsheet
newspapers
are
perceived
to
be
more
intellectual
in
content
in
comparison
to
tabloids,
which
tend
to
report
more
sensationalist
and
celebrity
material
.
Articles
relating
to
online
health
information
were
published
more
frequently
in
broadsheet
newspapers
than
in
tabloid
newspapers
.
Indeed,
only
one
relevant
article
was
found
in
the
US
tabloid
press
over
the
entire
10-year
period
of
interest
.
In
the
UK,
on
average,
4.9
articles
-LRB-SD
2.8-RRB-
were
published
in
broadsheet
newspapers
per
year,
which
was
significantly
higher
than
the
average
of
2.5
-LRB-SD
2.0-RRB-
articles
published
in
tabloid
newspapers
annually
-LRB-p=0.04-RRB-
.
In
approximately
two
thirds
-LRB-68.3%-RRB-
of
articles,
it
was
obvious
from
the
headline
that
the
article
related
to
health
information
on
the
Internet
.
Approximately
a
quarter
of
the
selected
articles
-LRB-24.8%-RRB-
were
published
in
health
sections
and
approximately
one
fifth
appeared
in
feature
-LRB-18.6%-RRB-
and
business
-LRB-18.0%-RRB-
sections
.
Interestingly,
on
only
one
occasion
did
the
topic
feature
in
the
editorial/leader
section,
indicating
the
low
priority
given
to
the
topic
by
newspaper
editors
.
Authorship
and
information
sources
Journalists
wrote
a
substantial
proportion
of
the
articles
-LRB-83.2%-RRB-
and
health
professionals
wrote
relatively
few
-LRB-9.9%-RRB-,
although,
in
approximately
a
quarter
-LRB-22.4%-RRB-
of
the
articles
authored
by
journalists,
a
health
professional
was
cited
as
the
main
source
of
the
information
.
Other
sources
included
published
reports
or
articles,
or
their
authors
-LRB-18.6%-RRB-,
spokespersons
from
the
IT
industry
-LRB-12.4%-RRB-
or
from
a
Government/National
Health
Service
-LRB-NHS-RRB-
department
-LRB-9.3%-RRB-
.
Thirty
articles
were
informed
by
a
scientific
report
or
journal
article
.
The
most
frequently
cited
reports
were
those
published
by
the
Pew
Internet
and
American
Life
Project
.
Almost
two
thirds
of
the
articles
-LRB-62.7%-RRB-
included
quotations
from
patients,
medical
or
industry
experts
.
Content
of
newspaper
articles
Online
health
information
was
the
main
theme
in
the
majority
-LRB-65.2%-RRB-
of
articles
.
Other
themes
included
the
Internet
as
a
medium
for
health-related
communication
between
the
public
and/or
health
professionals
-LRB-11.8%-RRB-,
access
to
online
personal

Balance
and
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
The
majority
of
articles
-LRB-83.9%-RRB-
were
rated
as
having
balanced
judgement,
i.e
the
authors
neither
made
exaggerated
nor
understated
claims
in
comparison
with
the
generally
accepted
status
of
online
health
information
.
The
quality
of
information
presented
in
each
article
was
rated
with
the
aid
of
descriptors
on
a
scale
of
1-10
.
Higher
scores
indicated
higher
quality
reporting
.
A
typical
high
quality
article
had
balanced
judgement,
was
based
on
evidence,
and
included
quotations
from
subject
experts,
whereas,
an
article
was
rated
as
poor
if
it
was
anecdotal,
lacked
balanced
judgement
and
did
not
include
any
evidence
in
support
of
its
claims
.
Overall,
47.2%
of
the
articles
were
rated
as
having
excellent
quality
reporting
-LRB-scored

32.9%

Discussion
We
found
a
low
frequency
of
reporting
on
online
health
information
in
the
highest
circulation
UK
and
US
newspapers
during
the
period
1st
January
2003
to
31st
December
2012
.
During
the
same
period,
the
number
of
relevant
research
studies
archived
in
PubMed
more
than
doubled
from
130
papers
in
2003
to
279
papers
in
2012
.
Newspapers
are
more
likely
to
report
on
studies
that
have
been
press-released
-LSB-26-RSB-,
therefore,
the
low
level
of
reporting
may
be
attributed
to
lack
of
promotion
of
research
to
newspaper
editors
by
scientists
or
journals
that
publish
in
this
area
.
Alternatively,
newspaper
editors
may
perceive
that
the
use
of
the
Internet
as
a
health
information
source
is
not
newsworthy
or
that
the
potential
for
harm
associated
with
reliance
on
online
health
information
is
not
an
important
public
health
issue
.
Although
overall
UK
and
US
newspaper
reporting
on
online
health
information
was
low,
peaks
were
evident
in
2003
and
in
2009
-LRB-Figure2-RRB-
.
During
the
analysis,
we
noted
that
the
majority
of
articles
published
in
these
years
reported
the
advice
and
information
available
online
during
the
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
-LRB-SARS-RRB-
outbreak
in
2003
and
the
H1N1
influenza
pandemic
in
2009
.
This
suggests
that
both
UK
and
US
newspaper
editors
saw
a
need
to
inform
the
public
where
to
look
for
health
information
at
times
when
public
health
was
threatened
.
Indeed,
UK
newspaper
reporting
on
the
H1N1
virus
in
general
peaked
during
the
summer
of
2009,
mirroring
the
peak
in
UK
cases
of
swine
flu
-LSB-25-RSB-
.
This
finding
supports
Gupta
and
Sinhas
assertion
that
coverage
of
health
concerns
in
the
news
media
tends
to
be
higher
when
the
issue
affects
the
greatest
number
of
people
in
their
audience
-LSB-27-RSB-
.
Broadsheet
versus
tabloid
reporting
on
online
health
information
A
broad
range
of
newspapers
across
the
readership
spectrum
was
included
in
the
study
.
Articles
in
the
US
newspaper
media
were
almost
exclusively
published
in
broadsheet
newspapers
.
Similarly,
significantly
more
UK
articles
were
published
in
broadsheets
even
though
tabloid
papers
made
up
a
greater
proportion
of
the
UK
sample
.
The
National
Readership
Survey
indicates
that
the
three
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
-LRB-The
Sun,
Daily
Mail,
Daily
Mirror-RRB-
are
all
tabloids
and
are
predominantly
read
by
lower
-LRB-C2DE-RRB-
social
classes
-LSB-14-RSB-
.
Thus,
readers
of
the
tabloid
press
are
unlikely
to
receive
guidance
on
searching
for
or
using
online
health
information,
or
web
site
recommendations,
from
their
newspapers
.
Also,
within
broadsheet
newspapers,
the
majority
of
articles
appeared
in
their
health
sections,
which
suggests
that
these
important
messages
may
be
reaching
a
very
limited
range
of
readers
.
Content
of
newspaper
articles
Our
results
support
Adelman
and
Verbrugges
suggestion
that
diseases
associated
with
high
mortality
rates
receive
the
highest
volume
of
newspaper
coverage
-LSB-28-RSB-
.
In
articles
that
linked
online
health
information
to
specific
diseases,
diabetes
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
illness,
while
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease
categories
were
the
central
nervous
system
-LRB-CNS-RRB-,
malignant
disease
and
cardiovascular
disease
.
Articles
that
discussed
online
health
information
in
relation
to
CNS
disease
encompassed
a
wide
range
of
both
neurological
and
mental
illnesses,
although
depression
was
the
most
frequently
mentioned
disease
in
this
category
.
The
relatively
high
level
of
newspaper
reporting
on
this
illness
correlates
with
suicide
being
the
leading
cause
of
death
in
adults
under
the
age
of
35
years
in
the
UK
-LSB-29-RSB-
.
Our
results
reinforce
the
suggestion
of
previous
researchers
that
newspapers
overemphasise
benefits
and
under-represent
risks
when
reporting
on
health
interventions
-LSB-16,
17-RSB-
.
It
was
interesting
to
observe
that
this
disparity
was
greater
among
US
newspapers,
although
the
differences
between
UK
and
US
newspapers
were
not
statistically
significant
.
Overstating
the
benefits
of
online
health
information
may
raise
public
expectations
unrealistically,
potentially
leading
to
harm
if
an
individual
acts
on
misleading
information
without
discussing
their
intentions
with
a
health
professional
.
The
acceptability
of
the
Internet
as
a
credible
source
of
health
information
in
clinical
practice
largely
depends
on
how
it
is
perceived
by
health
care
professionals
.
Opinions
expressed
in
articles
were
mixed
although
more
professionals
-LRB-55%-RRB-
expressed
positive
views
.
Quality
of
press
reporting
Our
findings
add
to
the
body
of
evidence
that
the
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
on
health
issues
is
variable
.
Less
than
half
of
articles
were
classified
as
having
excellent
information
and
the
remainder
were
deemed
to
be
of
average/good
or
poor
quality
.
Wilson
et
al
reported
poor
but
improving
quality
of
newspaper
reporting
on
a
variety
of
health
interventions
between
2004
and
2008
-LSB-30-RSB-
whereas
Hilton
and
Hunt
found
that
newspaper
reporting
during
the
2009
H1N1
influenza
epidemic
was
largely
measured
-LSB-25-RSB-
.
Strengths
and
limitations
of
study
This
is
the
first
comprehensive
investigation
of
how
the
highest
circulation
newspapers
in
the
UK
and
US
portray
online
health
information
to
their
readers
.
Although
the
mass
media
encompasses
the
Internet,
television,
radio,
newspapers
and
magazines,
we
limited
the
scope
of
our
study
to
the
newspaper
media
for
several
reasons
.
Firstly,
newspapers
have
a
wide
readership
in
both
the
UK
and
US
.
Secondly,
the
existence
of
an
online
database
of
full
text
newspaper
articles
provided
an
efficient
mechanism
to
search
for
and
obtain
articles
published
within
the
period
of
interest
.
Thirdly,
there
is
evidence
of
a
strong
correlation
between
newspaper
reporting
and
other
mass
media
coverage
of
similar
issues
-LSB-31-RSB-
.
Our
analysis
was
limited
to
higher
circulation
newspapers,
although,
circulation
figures
are
estimated
based
on
the
number
of
newspapers
sold
and
not
on
the
actual
readership
.
Finally,
there
was
limited
availability
of
some
US
newspaper
articles
within
the
NexisUK
database
.
Only
the
previous
six
months
of
Los
Angeles
Times
articles
and
only
abstracts
of
Wall
Street
Journal
articles
were
available
.
Further
limitations
are
the
retrospective
nature
of
the
data
collection,
although
a
prospective
study
over
10
years
would
be
impractical,
and
the
use
of
a
single
coder
for
the
majority
of
the
data
collection,
although
a
calibration
exercise
with
a
second
coder
was
undertaken
.
Conclusions
The
extent
of
newspaper
coverage
of
health
information
on
the
Internet
was
found
to
be
low
in
comparison
to
the
level
of
research
published
on
this
topic
.
In
common
with
the
findings
of
previous
research
on
newspaper
coverage
of
health
issues,
journalists
tended
to
emphasise
the
benefits
and
understate
the
risks
of
online
health
information,
and
the
quality
of
reporting
varied
considerably
.
Articles
that
reported
on
online
health
information
focussed
on
common
illnesses
that
are
associated
with
high
mortality
rates
.
Nevertheless,
newspaper
editors
perceived
a
need
to
report
on
online
information
when
public
health
was
threatened
by
global
epidemics
.
Dissemination
was
generally
via
the
health
sections
of
broadsheet
newspapers,
limiting
coverage
to
a
relatively
small
and
potentially
already
well-informed
readership
.

Guimaresand
neighboring
areas
in
the
Atlantic

in
the
south
of
the
Brazilian
state
of
Bahia
.
These
new
species
belong
to
three
genera
from
three
distinct
lineages
in
the
family
Melastomataceae:
Huberia,
Meriania
and
Physeterostemon
.
The
description
of
these
species
represent
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
i.e.,
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
about
the
biodiversity
in
the
area,
as
well
as
in
tropical
forests
as
a
whole
.
The
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both
genetic
and
morphological-RRB-
stock,
and
thus
is
also
valuable
as
a
phylogenetic
conservation
priority
.
Introduction
Studies
on
biodiversity
and
evolutionary
biology
have
been
traditionally
hindered
by
gaps
in
basic,
natural
history
knowledge,
no
matter
what
kind
of
methods
or
organisms
they
deal
with
.
These
shortfalls
can
be
linked
to
the
lack
of
taxonomic
work,
i.e.,
species
descriptions
-LRB-Linnean
shortfall;
Brown
&
Lomolino,
1998;
Whittaker
et
al.,
2005-RRB-
or
absence
of
data
regarding
their
distribution
-LRB-Wallacean
shortfall;
Bini
et
al.,
2006-RRB-
.
Both
lead
to
a
third
gap
in
our
knowledge:
the
lack
of
information
on
phylogenetic
relationships,
and
thus
the
evolutionary
history
of
life
on
Earth
-LRB-i.e.,
Darwinian
shortfall,
Diniz-Filho
et
al.,
2013-RRB-
.
The
forests
of
eastern
Brazil
-LRB-Atlantic
Forest
or
Mata
Atlntica-RRB-
harbor
an
incredible
amount
of
biodiversity,
and
are
considered
one
of
the
biodiversity
hotspots
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000-RRB-
.
With
less
than
10%
of
the
original
vegetation
remaining,
the
Atlantic
Forest
is
also
a
high
conservation
priority
-LRB-Myers
et
al.,
2000;
Ribeiro
et
al.,
2009-RRB-
.
Our
knowledge
about
biodiversity
in
this
area
is
not
static
as
inventories
of
angiosperms
have
shown
.
In
2009
the
list
of
flowering
plants
from
the
Atlantic
Forest
contained
ca
13,700
species
-LRB-Stehmann
et
al.,
2009-RRB-,
while
the
most
recent
account
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
includes
ca
15,000
species
.
In
both
cases
4949.5%
of
the
species
are
reported
as
endemic
.
This
1,300
species
increase
within
six
years
is
mainly
due
to
the
participation
of
specialists
for
most
plant
families
and
the
heavy
use
of
new
informatic
tools
-LRB-BFG,
2015-RRB-
.
However,
this
increase
also
includes
new
species
being
described
at
a
steady
rate
.
In
a
16
year
span
-LRB-19902006-RRB-,
1,194
species
of
angiosperms
were
described
for
the
Atlantic
Forest
-LRB-Sobral
&
Stehmann,
2009-RRB-,
which
represents
an
increase
of
about
80
species
per
year
.
Taking
the
total
13,700
species
surveyed
in
2009,
this
means
that
almost
8.7%
of
these
species
were
described
in
the
previous
15
years
.
This
high
species
description
rate
of
angiosperms
has
been
more
intense
in
the
middle
section
of
Atlantic
Forest
from
southern
Bahia
trough
Esprito
Santo
and
North
Eastern
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
The
forests
in
that
range
are
very
rich
for
both
plants
-LRB-Martini
et
al.,
2007;
Leitman
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
animals
-LRB-Carnaval
&
Moritz,
2008;
Carnaval
et
al.,
2009;
Silva
et
al.,
2012-RRB-
.
Moreover,
these
areas
have
been
historically
poorly
collected,
and
thus
lesser
known
than
the
southern
portions
of
Atlantic
Forest
in
So
Paulo,
Paran
and
Santa
Catarina,
and
central
and
western
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
Recent
collection
efforts,
especially
in
medium
to
high
altitudes
have
yielded
several
new
species
-LRB-for
Melastomataceae
only:
Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009;
Goldenberg
&
Reginato,
2009;
Baumgratz,
Amorim
&

2011;

&

.
This
was
also
the
case
for
our
four
short,
34-day
collection
trips
to
small
area
within
the
municipality
of
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
southern
Bahia
.
These
trips
provided
enough
material
for
the
description
of
three
new
species
of
Melastomataceae,
from
three
different
genera:
Huberia
DC.,
Meriania
Sw
.
and
Physeterostemon
R
Goldenb
.
&
Amorim
.
These
genera
belong
to
distinct
lineages,
respectively
the
Merianthera
clade
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2012-RRB-,
tribe
Merianieae
-LRB-Goldenberg
et
al.,
2015-RRB-,
and
Miconieae/Eriocnema
clade
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009-RRB-
.
Huberia
has
16
species,
most
of
them
from
eastern
Brazil
except
for
four
species
found
in
the
Andes
in
Peru
and
Ecuador
-LRB-Baumgratz,
2004-RRB-
.
Meriania
has
95110
species,
ranging
from
southern
Mexico
and
Caribbean
to
Bolivia
and
southeastern
Brazil
-LRB-Michelangeli,
Carmenate-Reyes
&
Sosa,
2015-RRB-
.
Physeterostemon
has
four
species,
all
endemic
to
southern
Bahia
-LRB-Amorim,
Jardim
&
Goldenberg,
2014-RRB-
.
The
discovery
of
three
distantly
related
species
in
the
same
family
and
in
the
same
area
underscores
our
lack
of
knowledge
for
several
groups
and
areas
of
the
tropics
.
It
is
important
to
emphasize
that
every
one
of
the
three
species
described
here
has
characters
that
are
unique
within
their
respective
lineages
-LRB-see
discussions
below-RRB-,
thus
the
discovery
of
these
new
species
goes
beyond
that
of
adding
to
species
to
groups
and
areas,
but
also
greatly
add
to
our
knowledge
of
morphological
diversity
and
evolution
for
each
of
the
three
genera
.
Moreover,
some
of
the
groups
described
in
the
last
10
years
represent
key
lineages
heretofore
unknown
.
An
example
is
Physeterostemon
-LRB-Goldenberg
&
Amorim,
2006-RRB-,
first
described
from
two
species
from
southern
Bahia,
and
that
turned
out
to
represent
the
sister
group
of
the
Miconieae
-LRB-Amorim,
Goldenberg
&
Michelangeli,
2009-RRB-,
an
exclusively
Neotropical
group
with
ca
2,000
species
.
The
description
of
the
species
here
is
as
a
good
example
of
a
Linnean
shortfall,
because
three
new
species
from
a
single
family
are
found
in
the
same
place,
disclosing
the
absence
of
basic
knowledge
regarding
the
biodiversity
of
the
area
.
As
for
conservation
purposes,
the
description
of
these
probably
endemic
species
per
se
is
a
signal
that
this
area
deserves
more
attention
regarding
research
and
policies,
but
its
consequences
go
farther:
this
area
has
a
relevant
role
as
a
phylogenetic
-LRB-both
genetic
and
morphological-RRB-

et
al.,

and
thus
is
also
valuable
as
a
phylogenetic
conservation
priority
.
Study
Area
The
Estao
Ecolgica
Estadual
de
Wenceslau
Guimares
-LRB-EEEWG-RRB-
was
created
in
1997
and
enlarged
in
2000,
totaling
2,418
hectares
-LRB-Bahia,
2010-RRB-
.
The
reserve
is
contained
within
a
single
municipality,
Wenceslau
Guimares,
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
state
of
Bahia,
Brazil
-LRB-Fig
1-RRB-
.
Its
geomorphology
includes
deep
and
straight
valleys
200500
m
wide,
at
550
m
elevation
at
the
lowest
point,
and
enclosed
by
mountains
up
to
1,000
m
elevation,
with
slopes
ranging
mostly
between
15
and
50
.
The
soils
are
mostly
alic
Oxisols,
but
there
are
also
Lithic
Psamments
and
Ultisols
.
The
climate
is
tropical
and
humid,
but
some
slopes
facing
west
can
be
considered
as
sub-humid
.
The
annual
mean
temperature
ranges
between
22
and
25.5
C,
and
rainfall
between
800
and
1,500
mm
-LRB-Bahia,
2010-RRB-
.
The
area
surrounding
the
reserve
has
been
almost
entirely
logged
and
cleared
.
It
is
nowadays
covered
with
small
rural
properties,
and
the
agricultural
activities
are
based
mostly
on
cocoa,
fruticulture
-LRB-mostly
soursop,
locally
called
graviola,
and
sold
as
frozen
pulp-RRB-
and
subsistence
crops
.
Some
areas
inside
the
reserve
has
been
cleared
and
used
for
agricultural
purposes
for
a
long
time
up
to
the
1990s,
but
now
there
are
no
families
living
in
it
anymore
.
Apart
from
some
areas
covered
with
secondary
vegetation,
mostly
on
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
and
lower
slopes,
the
reserve
is
covered
with
sub-montane
tropical
moist
forest

On
slopes
up
to

the
canopy
is
815
m
high,
and
average
trunk
diameter
1530
cm,
with

m
tall
and
1
m
diameter;
the
understory
is
well
developed
and
the
trees
usually
heavy
with

Diagnosis
.
A
species
of
Huberia
that
differs
from
all
other
species
in
the
genus
due
to
the
sessile
leaves
with
subcordate
to
cordate
bases,
short
-LRB-11.3
mm
long-RRB-
sepals,
and
the
connective
with
a
very
short

Description
.
Trees

few
erect
branches
.
Young
stems,
leaves,
inflorescences
and
hypanthia
glutinose
-LRB-both
in
fresh

dry
specimens-RRB-,
covered
with
glandular
trichomes
with
very
short
stalks,
which
are
more
distinctive
on
both
leaf
surfaces,
where
they
are
located
on
depressions
and
look
more
like
dots
than
trichomes,
otherwise
glabrous
.
Young
stems
slightly
quadrangular
or

Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
sessile
leaves,
which
are
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
this
species
.
Remarks
.
All
species
of
Huberia
known
to
date
have
petiolate
leaves,
with
bases
ranging
from
cuneate
and
decurrent
to
obtuse
to
rounded
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-
.
No
described
species
present
the
sessile
leaves
with
subcordate
to
cordate
bases
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
The
character
combination
of
short
sepals
and
short
connective
appendages
can
be
found
in
H
glazioviana
Cogn
.
and
H
consimilis
Baumgratz
.
However
in
these
species
the
connective
appendage
ranges
from
1.5
to
4
mm
long
in
the
former,
and
1.3
to
4.7
mm
long
in
the
latter
-LRB-Baumgratz,
1997-RRB-,
thus
usually
longer
than
the
1.31.7
mm
long
ones
found
in
H
sessilifolia
.
Apart
from
the
petiolate
leaves
with
acute
to
obtuse
bases,
H
glazioviana
also
differ
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
pubescent
branches
and
leaves,
while
H
consimilis
differs
from
H
sessilifolia
on
the
longer

Meriania
inflata
is
known
from
only
one
collection
from
forests
within
the
Estao
Ecolgica
Estadual
Wenceslau
Guimares
in
southern
Bahia
.
At
the
time
of
collecting
the
type
specimen
three
individuals
were
observed
.
Given
the
size
of
the
reserve
-LRB-24.2
km2-RRB-
and
potential
habitat,
we
recommend
that
Meriania
inflata
is
given
a
status
of
critically
endangered
-LRB-IUCN,
2014-RRB-
.
Etymology
.
The
epithet
refers
to
the
two
inflated
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
.
This
character
occurs
in
both
Meriania
inflata
and
Meriania
tetramera,
and
makes
these
two
species
very
distinctive
among
other
species
of
Meriania
.
Remarks
.
Among
the
Eastern
Brazilian
species
of
Meriania,
the
indument
and
anther
morphology
of
M
inflata
are
very
similar
to
those
of
M
tetramera
-LRB-Chiavegatto,
2009;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2008;
Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-
.
This
anther
morphology
with
paired
sacs
at
the
base
of
the
thecae
is
not
known
in
any
other
species
in
the
genus
apart
from
M
inflata
and
M
tetramera
.
This
feature
is
undoubtedly
associated
with
the
pollination
biology
of
these
species,
but
nothing
is
known
about
the
natural
history
of
either
species
.
While
Meriania
tetramera
also
has
greenish
petals
and
plinerved
leaves,
the
two
species
can
be
readily
distinguished
because
Meriania
tetramera
has
4-merous
flowers
and
a
calyx
closed
in
bud
that
opens
irregularly
.
The
leaf
and
hypanthium
indument
of
M
inflata
is
also
similar
to
that
of
M
calophylla
-LRB-Naudin-RRB-
Triana
.
However,
M
calophylla
has
narrower
leaves
that
are
basally-nerved,
much
larger
flowers
with
purple
to
lavender
petals
at
anthesis,
and
dimorphic
stamens
with
dorsal
ascending
appendages
.
In
the
recent
key
to
Brazilian
Meriania
-LRB-Chiavegatto
&
Baumgratz,
2015-RRB-,
M
inflata
would
not
fit
either
of
the
options
in
the
first
couplet
as
the
inflorescences
are
pendulous
or
deflexed
-LRB-as
in
M
glazioviana
Cogn
.
and
M
longipes
Triana-RRB-
but
the
peduncle
is
less
than
4
cm
long
