The	O
most	O
frequent	O
methodological	O
shortcoming	O
in	O

was	O
lack	O
of	O
blinding	O
of	O

to	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O

that	O
the	O

included	O
trials	O
-LSB-34-RSB--LSB-42-RSB-	O
.	O
And	O
we	O
identified	O
several	O
implications	O
for	O
further	O
research	O
.	O
First,	O
future	O
trials	O
should	O
adequately	O
use	O
random	O
sequence	O
generation	O
and	O
random	O
concealment,	O
and	O
completely	O
report	O
outcome	O
data	O
.	O
Second,	O
future	O
studies	O
should	O
be	O
conducted	O
in	O
populations	O
that	O
best	O
represent	O
patients	O
with	O
chronic	O
LBP;	O
hence,	O
patient	O
selection	O
should	O
be	O
carefully	O
considered	O
.	O
Third,	O
SE	O
should	O
be	O
well	O
designed,	O
and	O
interventions	O
should	O
be	O
thoroughly	O
described	O
.	O
The	O
treatment	O
affected	O
short-term	O
back	O
pain	O
specific	O
functional	O
status	O
between	O
SE	O
and	O
other	O
forms	O
of	O
exercise	O
at	O
a	O
less	O
extent	O
in	O
trials	O
in	O
which	O
SE	O
was	O
performed	O
less	O
frequently	O
-LSB-34-RSB-	O
.	O
Hence,	O
studies	O
should	O
evaluate	O
the	O
frequency	O
at	O
which	O
SE	O
is	O
more	O
effective	O
than	O
others	O
for	O
the	O
treatment	O
of	O
chronic	O
LBP	O
.	O
Fourth,	O
the	O
outcome	O
measures	O
for	O
future	O
studies	O
should	O
include	O
pain	O
intensity,	O
functional	O
status,	O
and	O
general	O
health	O
.	O
This	O
recommendation	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
standard	O
use	O
of	O
outcome	O
measures	O
in	O
back	O
pain	O
research	O
in	O
1998,	O
including	O
a	O
minimum	O
of	O
pain	O
intensity,	O
functional	O
status,	O
and	O
general	O
health	O
measures	O
-LSB-68-RSB-	O
.	O
We	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
intermediate	O
or	O
long-term	O
efficacy	O
associated	O
with	O
SE	O
should	O
be	O
accurately	O
assessed,	O
particularly	O
with	O
standardized	O
methods	O
to	O
report	O
outcomes	O
based	O
on	O
published	O
recommendations	O
.	O
Fifth,	O
further	O
studies	O
should	O
also	O
be	O
conducted	O
regarding	O
the	O
relative	O
cost	O
effectiveness	O
of	O
SE	O
and	O
the	O
potential	O
active	O
mechanisms	O
of	O
SE	O
for	O
chronic	O
LBP	O
.	O
Sixth,	O
researchers	O
should	O
register	O
RCTs	O
and	O
adhere	O
to	O
the	O
CONSORT	O
guidelines	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
studies	O
.	O
Journals	O
on	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
back	O
pain	O
should	O
adopt	O
reporting	O
guidelines	O
and	O
apply	O
these	O
guidelines	O
in	O
their	O
review	O
process	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
future	O
reports	O
in	O
this	O
field	O
-LSB-51-RSB-,	O
-LSB-69-RSB-	O
.	O
Conclusions	O

in	O
