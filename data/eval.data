New
inhibitors
of
influenza
viruses
are
needed
to
combat
the
potential
emergence
of
novel
human
influenza
viruses.

We
have
identified
a
class
of
small
molecules
that
inhibit
replication
of
influenza
virus
at
picomolar
concentrations
in
plaque
reduction
assays.

The
compound
also
inhibits
replication
of
vesicular
stomatitis
virus.

Time
of
addition
and
dilution
experiments
with
influenza
virus
indicated
that
an
early
time
point
of
infection
was
blocked
and
that
inhibitor
136
tightly
bound
to
virions.

Using
fluorescently
labeled
influenza
virus,
inhibition
of
viral
fusion
to
cellular
membranes
by
blocked
lipid
mixing
was
established
as
the
mechanism
of
action
for
this
class
of
inhibitors.

Stabilization
of
the
neutral
pH
form
of
hemagglutinin
-LRB-HA-RRB-
was
ruled
out
by
trypsin
digestion
studies
in
vitro
and
with
conformation
specific
HA
antibodies
within
cells.

Direct
visualization
of
136
treated
influenza
virions
at
pH
7.5
or
acidified
to
pH
5.0
showed
that
virions
remain
intact
and
that
glycoproteins
become
disorganized
as
expected
when
HA
undergoes
a
conformational
change.

This
suggests
that
exposure
of
the
fusion
peptide
at
low
pH
is
not
inhibited
but
lipid
mixing
is
inhibited,
a
different
mechanism
than
previously
reported
fusion
inhibitors.

We
hypothesize
that
this
new
class
of
inhibitors
intercalate
into
the
virus
envelope
altering
the
structure
of
the
viral
envelope
required
for
fusion
to
cellular
membranes.

Introduction
Influenza
virus
is
an
enveloped
virus
belonging
to
the
Orthomyxoviridae
family.

Waterfowls
are
the
natural
reservoir
for
most
influenza
A
subtypes.

Avian
influenza
viruses
bind
with
high
affinity
to
2,3
linked
sialic
acid
containing
receptors
and
with
low
affinity
to
2,6
linked
receptors,
the
converse
applies
for
human
influenza
viruses
-LSB-1-RSB-.

Species
such
as
pigs
that
contain
both
2,3
and
2,6
linked
receptors
allow
coinfection
with
both
human
and
avian
influenza
viruses
-LSB-2-RSB-.

Genome
reassortment
of
coinfecting
influenza
viruses
may
result
in
a
new
influenza
virus
strain
containing
different
subtypes
of
HA
-LRB-hemagglutinin-RRB-
or
NA
-LRB-neuraminidase-RRB-
previously
unseen
in
humans.

Humans
may
not
have
preexisting
immunity
to
a
new
strain
of
influenza
virus,
so
pandemics
can
result
from
genome
reassortment
-LSB-3-RSB-.

Human
cases
of
H5N1
have
occurred
sporadically
since
1997
and
in
2013
human
cases
of
H7N9
have
been
reported
-LSB-4-RSB-.

Both
H5N1
and
H7N9
are
highly
pathogenic
in
humans
and
are
currently
circulating
in
avian
reservoirs
-LSB-4-RSB-.

The
potential
of
H5N1
or
H7N9
viruses
to
jump
to
humans
emphasize
the
need
for
broad
spectrum
influenza
inhibitors
since
vaccine
development
would
require
months.

Considering
the
possibility
of
increased
resistance
to
neuraminidase
inhibitors
-LSB-5,
6-RSB-,
and
the
threat
of
avian
viruses
to
gain
transmissibility
among
humans,
new
influenza
inhibitors
are
urgently
needed.

Fusion
inhibitors
have
been
successfully
used
in
the
treatment
of
HIV
-LSB-7-RSB-.

For
instance,
enfuvirtide
is
a
peptide
derived
from
gp41
that
blocks
refolding
of
gp41,
effectively
arresting
fusion
of
HIV
to
the
cell
membrane
-LSB-810-RSB-.

A
peptide
based
inhibitor
with
a
cholesterol
moiety
attached
has
successfully
targeted
influenza
virus
fusion
in
vitro
-LSB-11-RSB-.

LJ001,
a
small
molecule
able
to
inhibit
fusion
of
many
pseudotyped
enveloped
viruses,
proves
that
small
molecules
can
block
the
fusion
pathway
of
viruses
-LSB-12-RSB-.

If
the
influenza
virus
fusion
pathway
could
be
targeted
effectively
by
small
molecule
inhibitors,
these
inhibitors
could
become
an
important
new
class
of
inhibitors
for
controlling
influenza
virus.

A
potent
inhibitor
of
influenza
virus,
-LRB-Z-RRB--3--LRB-bicyclo-LSB-2.2.1-RSB-heptan-2-yl-RRB--5--LRB--LRB-5--LRB-4-chlorophenyl-RRB--3--LRB-3--LRB-piperazin-1-yl-RRB-pentyl-RRB-furan-2-yl-RRB--methylene-RRB--2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one,
-LRB-named
compound
136,
S1
File-RRB-
was
developed
recently
-LSB-13-RSB-,
but
the
mechanism
of
inhibition
by
136
was
not
clearly
defined.

Here
we
report
that
136
interferes
with
the
fusion
process
of
influenza
virus,
likely
by
disrupting
the
structure
of
the
viral
envelope
necessary
for
fusion
to
cellular
membranes.

Materials
and
Methods
Cells
and
viruses
MDCK-2
cells
were
cultured
in
EMEM
supplemented
with
5%

To
confirm
that

indeed
binds
to

the

concentration
of
136
was
added
to
a

sample
and
then
diluted
by

was
first
diluted
by

pM
of
136.

As
a
negative
control
DMSO
was
added
and
the
sample
was
diluted
by
20
fold.

If
136
was
to
exchangeably
bind
to
the
virion,
it
should
diffuse
into
the
larger
volume
when
diluted
and
inhibit
the

amount
of

as
the
positive
control.

Fig.

shows
that
even
1
hour
after
dilution
136
still
inhibits
95%
of
the
virus,
which
is
consistent
with
its
tight
binding
to
the
virus.

Fluorescent
labeling
of
X-31

was
quantitated
in
the
presence
of
136
and
211,
as
well
as
DMSO
as
a
control
-LRB-Fig.

The
fluorescence
of
lipophilic
labeling
agent
DiD
was
further
quenched
below
the
control
background
by
136,
suggesting
that
136
binds
in
close
proximity
to
the
membrane
bound
DiD.

To
specifically
identify
the
influenza

entry
step
136
inhibits,
several
experiments
were
performed
in
A549
cells
as
described
by
Banerjee
et.

al.-LSB-14-RSB-.

To
determine
if
binding
to
the
host
cell
was
inhibited
by
136,
X-31
virus
treated
with
DMSO,
136,
or
211
were
bound
to
cells
in
the
presence
of
the
drug
for
1
hour
at
4C
so
internalization
of
the
virus
would
not
occur.

The
cells
were
washed
to
remove
unbound
virus,
and
the
bound
virus
was
quantitated
using
a
monoclonal

antibody
and
FACS
analysis

compared
to

211
or

did
not
prevent
the
conformational
rearrangement
of
HA
in

-LRB-Fig.

Addition
of
Bafilomycin

a
potent

prevented
the
low

-LRB-Fig.
4C-RRB-.

211
did
not
prevent
dequenching
of

indicating
that
lipid
mixing
occurred
normally.

In
contrast,
cells

To
further

that
the

we
performed

All
samples
left
at

7.5
with

show
no
degradation
of
HA
since
trypsin
is
unable
to
access
the

sites
without
the
conformational

of
HA.

HA
is
not
destabilized
by
136
at
pH

If
HA
was
destabilized,
we
would
expect

to
be
degraded
at

Additionally,
NP

Discussion
The
fusion
pathway
of
influenza
virus
has
been
extensively
studied
but
some
uncertainties
still
exist.

After
binding
to
cell
surface
receptors,
influenza
virus
is
internalized
either
by
clathrin
mediated
endocytosis
or
macropinocytosis
-LSB-17-RSB-.

During
endosomal
maturation,
low
intraluminal
pH
triggers
an
irreversible
conformational
change
of
HA,
exposing
the
fusion
peptide
-LSB-18,
19-RSB-.

The
unveiled
fusion
peptide
inserts
itself
between
bilayers
of
the
endosomal
membrane
and
HA
refolds
into
a
six-helix
bundle,
resulting
in
fusion
of
the
viral
membrane
to
the
endosomal
membrane
-LSB-20-RSB-.

This
mechanism
is
common
for
all
subtypes
of
influenza
A
virus
and
influenza
B
virus.

Our
new
inhibitor
136
targets
this
mechanism
and
has
potent
antiviral
activities
against
a
large
variety
of
influenza
viruses,
as
well
as
VSV.

The
results
of
our
time
of
addition,
dilution
of
inhibitor
bound
virus,
and
imaging
indicate
that
the
inhibitor
prevents
viral
fusion
with
cellular
membranes.

Trypsin
sensitivity
studies
and
electron
microscopy
further
revealed
that
the
inhibitor
does
not
perforate
the
viral
envelope,
stabilize
HA,
or
prevent
the
low
pH
induced
conformational
change
of
HA.

In
vitro
studies
of
136
treated
influenza
virus
suggests
that
the
structure
of
the
viral
envelope
was
changed
by
binding
of
136
to
the
virion.

The
baseline
fluorescence
of
DiD
labeled
virions
was
further
reduced
by
treatment
with
136
but
not
211
or
DMSO,
suggesting
that
136
intercalates
in
the
membrane
of
the
virus
in
close
proximity
to
DiD
-LRB-Fig.
3C-RRB-.

Our
experiments
clearly
show
that
136
blocks
lipid
mixing
of
the
influenza
virus
envelope
with
the
plasma
membrane
and
the
late
endosomal
membrane
of
A549
cells
-LRB-Fig.
4C
and
D-RRB-.

It
is
possible
that
integrity
of
the
viral
envelope
is
required
for
successful
viral
fusion
with
cellular
membranes.

Changes
of
viral
envelope
properties
induced
by
136
may
result
in
the
arrest
of
complete
membrane
fusion.

A
recent
paper
described
the
mechanism
of
inhibition
of
compound
LJ001
which
contains
a
portion
structurally
similar
to
136
-LSB-21-RSB-.

The
authors
demonstrate
that
LJ001
and
active
analogs
bind
to
lipid
bilayers
-LSB-21-RSB-.

In
the
presence
of
light
they
produce
reactive
oxygen
species
that
can
react
with
the
unsaturated
fatty
acid
chains
of
phospholipids
thus
disrupting
the
biophysical
properties
of
the
membrane
critical
to
the
fusion
process
-LSB-21-RSB-.

When
136
in
an
oxygen
atmosphere
was
subject
to
UV
irradiation
for
12
hours,
no
changes
in
its
NMR
profile
was
observed
-LRB-S2
Fig.-RRB-

,
suggesting
high
stability
of
136.

This
result
is
consistent
with
136
tightly
binding
to
the
virion
membrane.

We
hypothesize
that
binding
of
136
alters
the
structure
of
the
viral
envelope
preventing
it
from
fusing
with
cellular
membranes.

A
number
of
other
influenza
virus
entry
inhibitors
have
been
reported
-LRB-recently
reviewed
in
-LSB-22-RSB--RRB-.

Attachment
of
the
virus
to
the
host
cell
is
the
first
step
in
the
entry
pathway.

Peptides
and
small
molecules
that
mimic
sialic
acid
have
been
developed
that
bind
to
the
receptor
binding
pocket
of
HA
thus
preventing
attachment
and
internalization
of
the
virus
-LSB-2325-RSB-.

Additionally,
small
molecules
capable
of
binding
to
pockets
in
HA
prevent
the
low
pH
conformational
rearrangement
of
HA
necessary
for
fusion
-LSB-2633-RSB-.

and
D-RRB-.

Current
influenza
virus
inhibitors
target
viral
proteins
that
are
genetically
encoded
by
the
virus.

However,
influenza
virus
can
quickly
gain
resistant
mutations
-LSB-5,
34,
35-RSB-.

The
optimal
strategy
would
be
to
target
properties
of
the
virus
that
are
not
dominantly
genetically
encoded,
reducing
the
probability
of
the
virus
to
gain
quick
resistance
through
mutation
-LSB-36-RSB-.

Rigid
amphipathic
fusion
inhibitors
-LRB-RAFIs-RRB-
were
developed
to
inhibit
several
enveloped
viruses
by
binding
to
the
virion
membrane
-LSB-37-RSB-.

Resistant
mutants
of
HSV1
could
not
be
generated
against
RAFIs
-LSB-37-RSB-.

Similarly,
136
can
inhibit
influenza
virus
as
well
as
VSV
by
binding
to
the
viral
envelope
and
blocking
the
virus
from
fusing
with
cellular
membranes.

As
with
RAFIs,
clearly
resistant
mutants
to
136
could
not
be
selected
by
repeated
passages
at
sublethal
concentrations
or
by
selecting
a
preexisting
mutant
from
a
genetically
diverse
high
titer
virus
stock
-LRB-data
not
shown-RRB-.

The
binding
of
136
to
Influenza
virions
is
likely
related
to
the
transmembrane
domain
of
HA
and
the
unique
lipid
composition
in
the
viral
envelope,
which
may
still
change
when
substantial
mutations
occur
in
viral
proteins
that
determine
virus
assembly
and
budding.

However,
such
mutations
would
take
a
long
period
of
time
to
develop
and
the
mutant
virus
may
lose
its
fitness
to
become
less
infectious.
