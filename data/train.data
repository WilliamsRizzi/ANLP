Etymology.	O

The	B-time
epithet	I-time
refers	I-time
to	I-time
the	I-time
two	I-dna
inflated	O
sacs	B-time
at	I-time
the	I-time
base	I-time
of	I-time
the	I-time

This	B-time
character	I-time
occurs	I-dna
in	I-time
both	I-time
Meriania	O
inflata	O
and	O
Meriania	B-dna

This	B-time

with	I-time
paired	I-time

at	B-time
the	I-time

This	B-dna

the	I-dna
